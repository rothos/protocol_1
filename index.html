<p>v72 Mark D Lippmann Method (“Mastery Protocol”)</p>
<p>Copyright: All rights reserved.</p>
<p><strong>Catch-all/alpha/beta/draft disclaimer:</strong> I make many bold assertions in this document, and sometimes I use words like usually, often, etc., that may seem to imply I’m working from a large dataset. Please understand that the protocol has been most heavily tested by me, with a very small additional number of people who are using the protocol either heavily or at least semi-consistently. More and more people are trying this thing out as it becomes more widely known. But, we don’t have a lot of data, and, when I make bold claims, I’m extrapolating from everything I know, which will at minimum be many, many things adjacent to the protocol but not necessarily derived from empirical use of the protocol by other people, and in a very small number of cases, even myself. But, for what it’s worth, I eat my own dog food as it were. The protocol has been my sole transformative practice for thousands of hours, and I’ve tried extensively to suss out all former prerequisites and to incorporate them into the practice. And I’m tracking some of the users very carefully. I currently believe other people besides myself can use this thing to take themselves all the way.</p>

<h2>Preamble (draft!)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remember, you’re probably going to die. Remember that the universe may experience heat death. Remember that, in some sense, death and heat death are in some sense just ideas and concepts.</li>
<li>Remember that, while no one is obligated to give you or help you get these things, you deserve happiness, health, enjoyment, love, sex, family, and more.</li>
<li>Remember, in the relevant sense, you are the sole and final arbiter of what’s true, good, and beautiful. Feel what you feel. Do what you do. And, again, I think Crowley got something right, here, in the relevant sense (and possibly other things, too; i just haven’t investigated): Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love under will. (or something)</li>
<li>[…]</li>
<li>[…]</li>
<li>If you are at risk from sequelae of high blood pressure, intracranial pressure, or intraocular pressure (e.g. stroke, dissection, glaucoma), then you must not engage with the practices below or you must engage with them with extreme caution. If you have spinal or cervical abnormalities that could lead to spinal cord or nerve root impingement, then you must not engage with the practices below or you must engage with them with extreme caution. If you have other musculoskeletal risks then you must be careful.</li>
<li>Individuals residing in households with other residents below the age of eighteen or over the age of 65 should not engage in these practices after practice has been initiated, unless there is no one under the age of eighteen in the household and anyone over the age of 65 has consented to your doing these practices in residence after they’ve read this numbered list.</li>
<li>Women who are pregnant or you might become pregnant before asymptoting in these practices (e.g. 2-10 years, depending) should not engage in these practices.</li>
<li>If you are at risk for suicide, psychosis, or mania then you should engage with these practices with extreme caution.</li>
<li>If you have metabolic or cardiovascular disease such that a prolonged, inadvertent sedentary lifestyle (no exercise because of musculoskeletal sequelae) would be dangerous, then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If your immune system is under- or overactive, then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If you have experience abuse, psychological trauma, physical trauma, etc., then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If you engage with these practices then you must be aware that you could permanently ruin the rest of your life or die (sooner than you would otherwise). You must also be aware that the lives of people around you may be ruined or those people may die sooner as a result of your engaging these practices.</li>

<h2>An exoteric doctrine (v0.2)</h2>
<p>Objective and singular truth exists (and/or objective reality exists and objective truth corresponds to it).</p>
<p>Objective and singular goodness(/ethics/morality) exists.</p>
<p>The human mind is typically confused, uncertain, and ignorant. (Or, a typical person is…)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can know typically error-prone approximations of that objective truth and we can know/do approximations of that objective goodness.</p>
<p>Further, the human mind is asymptotically perfectible. That is, we can become better people in a practically unlimited way, all things being equal.</p>
<p>???There are more worse ways than better ways to interact with oneself and others.</p>
<p>In any moment you are the final arbiter of what’s true and good. You have to trust yourself while also being open to being wrong. This is hard but can get easier.</p>
<p>It’s possible to do more harm than good when trying or intending to do good and become better. (Also, you are the final arbiter of what’s better.)</p>
<p>Using systematic (albeit self-adapted) method is often or at least sometimes a good way to improve one’s approximations of truth and goodness. Stated alternatively, we can systematically seek to get the things we want and we can systematically come have better wants (want better things).</p>
<p>Some methods are better than others, depending on what you’re trying to do, such as knowing and doing better.</p>
<p>We want what we want until we want something else, and it’s ok or good to want what we want for as long as we want it.</p>
<p>Perhaps evil or malevolence is objective but things are only bad relative to your skill, power, and knowledge. Perfectibility (asymptotically) includes solving all your problems on your terms, in your words, until there is nothing left that is bad.</p>
<p>You might not feel good and safe all the time, but it’s good to want to feel good and safe, and it’s good to seek to stably feel good and safe or to feel good and safe as much as possible.</p>
<p>Without exception, and no matter how subtle the feeling, there’s always a valid sense in which, if it feels wrong it is wrong. [i.e. if X makes you feel wrong, then X is somehow wrong.] People often will systematically and relentlessly deny the relevant sense in order to try to immorally coerce and control you. Senses other than the relevant sense can be used to inappropriately destroy institutions. People trying to control you will try to convince you the former is the latter (among an unlimited number of other tactics that don’t refer to groups or institutions.) Of course, you could be mistaken about something or both could be happening. But that’s what the controlling people will do.</p>
<p>You might get hit by a bus or meteor or your cryo chamber might run out of geopolitics or something. But, it’s possible to have a good life, anyway, and it’s possible to impeccably work to reduce the chances of such bad things while having a good, complete, rich, full, life.</p>
<p>Most people will probably be happier striving for and maintaining a stable romantic pair-bond and having one or more kids.</p>
<p>Love properly labeled and defined is probably a uniquely important thing.</p>
<p>Some truths are exceptionless/universal and eternal or sempiternal. With correct method, you can know those truths by making use of whatever experiences you’ve already had (because those truths will massively redundantly inhere in those experiences without exception.) Some truths and knowledge of correct/good/moral knowledge/behavior are contingent (or relative to, or contextually dependent on, this world and time and place) and, to obtain them, you’ll need to dispel ignorance, to have experiences, to learn. You’ll be wrong and bad a lot. Also, you are good.</p>
<p>Progress is often multidimensionally nonmonotonic.</p>
<p>These are just words. This is just your interpretation of these words. Are there even words? You can’t know anything for sure; and that can be ok, with application of method or just because. There are more precise and accurate and deeper and more correct ways ways to say all the above.
More and more and more of everyone may come together to do good things that we couldn’t do alone.
Sometimes, an edgy joke should go here.
Let go…</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the absence of maintaining a quality introduction across releases, though that is a thing that needs to happen eventually or soon, here are comments by Jonathan, and edited text discussions with Jonathan, included with permission:</p>
<p>[Some of the edits change the original meaning a bit while still making the same point.]</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan [9:11 PM][Ed: 2019-04-11; 21:32 PDT]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a couple more things that come to mind maybe for future versions. excuse the ramble-i-ness</p>
<p>do you think it could be useful/important to table set a little bit? something along the lines of (but not necessarily this, just something in this direction): this will likely feel different from previous meditation you’ve done, if you’ve done some. i think past versions had something like this. and kind of for the reason I mentioned in […]: I could see people spending a fair amount of time trying to shoehorn this practice into their prior conception of what meditation practice is. i guess p2, p8, and p1 stand a good chance of addressing this directly without it having to be written out. i wonder how useful or not some making this explicit would be. :thinking_face:</p>
<p>and i also wonder if there’s some basic basic theory of mind that is good to mention right off-the-bat. it may very well not be a good thing, i’m not sure. here’s the kind of theory that might be good imo, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s like some kind of universal gradient/basin/attractor that the mind/brain is always, always, alway, always trying to fall down. one single direction, which might be why correct meditation works elegance, free energy minimization, dunno</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how the mind is really smart in some ways, sometimes/often moreso than the “personality” (i might be butchering the thing but that’s how i remember it)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and lots of little related things like this</p>
<p>for example wrt to the above, knowing stuff like this has made it easier for me to trust that the right things are happening at times, or trust that my mind can do good things, and stuff like that. depending on the models of mind people are running on i could expect there to be a lot of self fighting and self flailing and not self trusting in ways that might be bad. for example, if you’re coming from a tmi practice you might believe that your mind is this thing you need to wrangle, that you know better than, stuff like that. little bits of theory like this could help people understand how the practice works, why it’s different than practice they’ve done before, and possibly have the needed faith to try it out for 100+ hours</p>

<p><strong>Jonathan [4:32 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way I've been orienting to [this protocol versus other meditation protocols] myself recently is not through the meditation frame (though it is that and becomes that feel again eventually) but through the "going all the way to the bottom and from first principles as it were figuring out how to use a mind" frame, or something in the ballpark of that (edited)</p>
<p>It just cuts through a lot of the "is this meditation", or "am I doing the right thing" stuff, if you forget about meditation for a couple months and pretend it's not that, or something  (At least in my experience)</p>
<p>I guess this is a bit of a tangent now</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [5:15 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool. It is really different than [other] meditation [procedures] in a lot of ways. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [6:46 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah. i definitely think it is meditation. i'm probably being critically unappreciative, but there's a way in which other meditations are more narrow/constrained and this stuff is still meditation but wholeheartedly takes on the whole mind and every part of it. maybe it's all the same in the limit or something.</p>
<p>the concern is that i think i probably spent something like 50 - 100 hours (total total total total total ballpark) trying to make [this protocol into] what i understood to be meditation, or at least hours where this was on my mind and undermining practice, in a way. and even afterwards there have been and has been threads in my mind like "huh this doesn't feel like meditation so i must be doing something wrong". of course i think a lot of this is par for the course and part of tacking towards good and tacking towards better models of mind and meditation. like why does it feel wrong? why is one thing more meditation than another? but maybe with the right upfront expectation setting there's a way to just nip the shoehorning in a bud and save people time (edited)</p>
<p>[…]</p>

<p><strong>Mark [8:00 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trying to make this what i understood to be meditation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how does that look? can you say more? want to innoculate (and i'm sorry)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:03 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so after like n years knowing about tmi and noting and related practices, i had implicit models about how meditation works. the general general shape of the model was something like: your mind is a tool/machine, and you need to make it sensitive tool/machine such that one day it can finally pick up on some details of experience that lead to insight. step 1) develop powerful tool [powerful experienced as stable in the case of tmi, and perceptive in the case of noting]. step 2) use tool to examine reality</p>
<p>importantly nowhere in this model was there a sense that meaningful progress was being made up until the point of insight (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so like train tool/build microscope, then use microscope? does that simplify it too much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>nope that's pretty much exactly it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>hmm k</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i'm guessing this is common, but i'm not positive</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think ingram sort of implies this</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and there was a model for what made a good microscope too</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>like if you just use your microscope enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Jonathan [8:06 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think it was the model of what i thought made a good miscroscope that was especially problematic</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:06 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so then ppl like spend 1000 hours examining the blobs behind their closed eyes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think it was the model of what i thought made a good miscroscope that was especially problematic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>say more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:07 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sure. and eventually we should try to figure out why it is possible to have success with that metaphor. like, is it success in spite of the misconception? or is something else happening? [and ofc not everyone does have success and stuff]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Mark [8:07 PM] </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like, is it success in spite of the misconception?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i currently think so</p>
<p>noting is close enough that people can slip into doing the right thing, especially with a teacher who succeeded</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:08 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so as mentioned with both noting and concentration, even tho the skills are different, what a successful microscope looks like in both cases involves something in the ballpark of mindfulness or "with it ness"</p>
<p>"with it ness" that builds up into long interrupted stretches of "with it ness" over time</p>
<p>and so if you're doing one of these practices it's getting into one of these stretches that makes it feel like you're finally doing it right</p>
<p>"fuck, i'm really with the breath." or "fuck, i'm really with these vibrations"</p>
<p>something about sustained continuity of a thing over time seems to be the thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:09 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so like almost indiscriminately maxing out continuous contact with bare sensations, sort of?</p>
<p>i guess that's what you said</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah yeah that's in there too</p>
<p>and with this stuff, it doesn't seem like striving for uniterruptedness is important (until it happens on it's own), and it seems like there's plenty of room for non purely sense stuff too</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(noting that i myself thought exactly all of this. pretty much exactly.)</p>
<p>yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and so it didn't really feel like i was developing a microscope</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:11 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ah, ok</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:11 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah. even people who ahven't meditated before often have a model as it being about "no thinking", or "staying with the present"-ness
all of [that] is distinct from [this protocol]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(noting that i myself thought exactly all of this. pretty much exactly.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh cool! affirming yay</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:12 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yup</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Jonathan [10:24 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually I just kind of remembered something funny. I remember at SFDC in the fall with Shinzen, you were telling [S] and I something like, "I think the updates that happen leading up to streamentry are as important as streamentry". And I remember internally thinking: "what do you mean updates before streamentry??" In quite a literal sense I thought streamentry was like a single belief toggling from off to on (preceded by no updates of significance).</p>
<p>I think this sort of all or nothing thinking is quite common.</p>
<p>[… I]t also bounced off in the most important way because I had no mental model of how practice could work that would have being patient, locally-oriented, not obsessed with the supramundane as being the correct strategy. The reaction was something like, "ok […] that's very cool […] but there's still this streamentry insight waiting for me out there and nothing will be good until that"</p>
<p>So yeah, in many ways, I think for many meditators and nonmeditators, a very big update will be that updates happen along the way and the mind gets better and more liveable along the way. and what a relieving update too. being super explicit and not at all sidelining this (as you're doing) will go a long way to that end.</p>
<p>For this all to work, for the claim that updates happen along the way to be credible, one need's a place for those updates [i.e. mundane insights] to live.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I'm sure all of [other] teachers would claim that "things are supposed to get better along the way, and if they're not, you're missing the point." But I blame their implied models of mind and implied models of progress! You can claim that "things are supposed to get better along the way" but if you're not providing the right model of mind/progress or otherwise really really emphasizing it, it's just going to bounce out of students brains and sound like hollow wishful thinking or something. So in summary heh: good models of mind and progress are super duper helpful and consequential to practice</p>

<h2>Text interpretation</h2>
<p>There’s an ongoing project of collecting all the reasons why people bounce off of the document, plus corresponding supplementary information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The document does require text interpretation. Even if it was written in clean, grammatical prose, it would still need to be incrementally parsed and interpreted. It does need to be studied. Lengthy explanations would lose the “cutting at the joints,” in the document, where every word is included for a reason. Eventually, I do want there to be a softer entry. But that might be separate from the document itself. This does mean there are “startup costs” and initial cognitive overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main practices do need to be learned incrementally. It’s not possible to just pick them up and start doing them. Even after one can “hold an entire practice in their head,” the doing of it will still evolve substantially over time. So, there is additional cognitive overhead and a learning curve or even learning cliff, here, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main practices might initially seem not like meditation. But, they do asymptote at something that superficially looks like noting practice and shamatha without support. But, this is approached in a bottom up way, as opposed to a top-down way. (As a longer discussion, I currently think canonical concentration practices as well as things like metta being used as a concentration practice, are ultimately counterproductive, because their top-down nature sends a person off sharply on a direction that hasn’t been properly error-checked. And, I currently believe a person will have to do a lot of backtracking, given my understanding and experience of how the mind works.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the auxilliary/preliminary practices might seem suspiciously non-meditationy, like cognitive behavioral therapy or something. One of my goals was to combine the best of “western depth psychology” with the best of meditation. Lots of meditation practioners and teachers do have crushed or unresolved trauma and behavioral issues. The so-called “purifications” do a bunch of the work of western psychology, but they don’t go all the way, hence the somatic issues, sex scandals, and behavioral blindspots of lots of meditators. One can think of this practice as supercharging the purifications, making them much more comprehensive and thorough. At the same time, the practices do produce an experience of emptiness, and, asymptotically, nonduality. These practices go all the way to the very end, and then some.</p>

<p>My current best estimate is that these practices, even taking into account learning time, achieve various “classical milestones” about an order of magnitude faster than traditional practices. I’m still working this out. And, I expect speed gains and payoffs continue to accrue cumulatively and compoundingly. We shall see. In any case, this does continue to be an investment of thousands of hours. And, some payoffs come late in the game, while some payoffs to occur steadily. And there are still risks to be worked out and improved upon.</p>

<h2>Goal (draft)</h2>
<p>The goal of the practice is to have a good life, in the most broad and ordinary sense, on your terms, in your words, in your frame, or in no frame. That might look still, quiet, and intimate. That might look big and beautiful. (That might or might not include a good death.) That might look superficially normative and be quite nonnormative under the hood and in the cracks. Or that might quite normative in lots of ways. But the important thing is that it is good for and everyone you care about (which might be no one, everyone, etc.). It might end too soon or go on too long or who knows. In some sense you might fail: Maybe you or people you care about will get hit by a bus, a heart attack, a meteor, or a nuclear war. But the goal is to have a good (peaceful, interesting, exciting, fun, intimate, quiet, safe, stable, normal, extraordinary) life. That’s the point of all of this. (Asymptotically, nonmonotonically approaching self-perfection might be an interesting, fun, mediately traumatizing, opportunity-costly, incidental side effect.)</p>
<p>Part of having a good life is preparing and account for (the likely possibility of) death such that you actually have a good life. One can have a dispreference for death, while not fearing it, while competently and proactively avoiding it, while seamlessly having that be a part of everything else that is good.</p>
<p>One might have to give up everything in the pursuit of this goal, strangely, weirdly, even as lots of things stay superficially the same. In some ways getting everything you want will first cost you everything, will cost you your entire world, as you realize what you want is nothing like what you initially thought, that reality is nothing like what you initially thought, even though what you want appears superficially similar, in some ways, to what you previously wanted.</p>
<p>You get the good stuff back eventually, though.</p>
<p>“Better not to start. If you start, better to finish.”</p>
<p>“Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”</p>
<p>“Before practice, the mountains were just mountains. During practice, the mountains were no longer mountains. Eventually, the mountains were just mountains again.”</p>
<p>Your perception, behavior, ontology, judgments, and preferences get refactored, with lots of mistakes made along the way. Thousands of hours. Lots of opportunity cost. Also lots of opportunity gain. All things being equal, with enough starting resources (financial, relationships) and grace.</p>
<h2>End state (draft!)</h2>
<p>The end state is arrived at asymptotically. There’s always room for improvement because the world keeps changing. The journey will often be nonmonotonic, too.</p>
<p>In any case, what it sort of looks like is coming to be intrinsically motivated to optimize self and world, seamlessly, without limit or exception, to care for everything into the infinite future, including yourself, all together, all at once. (This comes with something like “getting lost in the intrinsically interesting whole-person intricacies of other people.”)</p>
<p>Being this way, all the way down to the core of your being, sort of cleanly solves all your problems in the moment and in the limit. [“Infinity” is just a concept, etc., etc. Don’t take refuge in your interpretation of these words. Let it all go.]</p>
<p>Another way to express this is “true (global) total (maximum) positive sum with no negative externalities.”</p>
<p>Another way to express this is “embodying a perfectly unified, eternal, sempiternal, and exceptionless will that’s going after the most good and best thing for everybody and everything, including yourself, without compromise or exception, all at once.</p>
<p>One comes to see that there are no terrible, hard truths and no terrible, hard tradeoffs.</p>
<p>One comes to know deeply that, if something feels or seems wrong, no matter how subtle, still, small, and quiet, then something is wrong, somewhere, and it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>You have to feel and listen, eventually, ultimately, to each, every, and all still, small, and quiet voice:</p>
<p>“If you’re good to them, then they’ll become good you.”</p>
<p>All of the above is not “turiya” or “nonduality,” but it is compatible with that “stateless state.”</p>
<p>Progressive insight into emptiness unlocks the capacity for turiya and the capacity for all the above. And progress towards turiya is usually progress towards all the above, and vice versa. Using the practices in this document will steadily, albeit nonmonotonically, move you towards all of this. You’ll incidentally get all the meditation-y goodness, too, without having to do anything special.</p>
<p>You will get all the meditation-y goodness, in addition to everything else (which I suspect was the goal of many non-modern-Buddhist systems).</p>
<p>You’ll be aiming at and asymptotically, nonmonotonically arriving at “mastery”/“perfection”/“flawlessness”.</p>
<p>There’s a final, additional piece which completes of all of this, that’s something like “proactive recursive bootstrapping,” progressively structuring self and world to learn about self and world more and more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Again, working with the practices in this document are intended to efficiently take you towards everything above.</p>
<p>A failure mode is trying to smash yourself into being what you think all the above must be like, by trying to directly aim at preconceived notions. If you don’t do all this “bottom up,” then you’ll tie yourself in knots.</p>
<p>The better thing to do is to <em>go after what you want,</em> systematically and iteratively resolving or correcting internal conflict and contradiction and error (with respect to goodness, truth, will, desire, etc., etc., etc.) along the way, and you’ll likely eventually find yourself in the neighborhood of something like what’s described, here. It will eventually be unified and elegant and a simplicity on the far side of complexity and not overwhelming or scattering or impossible. That’s what solving the puzzle box of the mind does. And it will be fun, meaningful, interesting, equanimous, captivating, loving, intimate, exciting, erotic, whatever.</p>
<p>Remember, in the relevant sense, you are the sole and final arbiter of what’s true, good, and beautiful. Feel what you feel. Do what you do. And, again, I think Crowley got something right, here, in the relevant sense (and possibly other things, too; i just haven’t investigated):</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love under will. (or something)</p>
<p>A key insight: If you know you’re doing the absolute best you can at all times in each moment taking into account all future times and all possible futures deep down in your bones then you just relax and let go, and it feels good</p>
<p>Related: You can stop checking, compensating, reminding, self-correcting, etc., if you know both that you’re up to date and also that you’ll responsively and seamlessly update in the presence of new information.</p>
<p>The “good for everyone all at once thing” is equivalent to solving all of your problems.</p>
<p>[For everything above, don’t take refuge in your interpretation of these words, or, if you do, hold it lightly. Let it all go. Let it all go to get the real thing back, later, in the right way, beyond your current conception. This is all just words. The whole document is just words. You must find your own truth or lack thereof, meaning or meaninglessness.]</p>
<p>Said one more time, the goal and the end-state (cf. wisdom, mastery, compassion, love, altruism):</p>
<p>The goal is to arrange self, life, and the entire world so that the guiltless seeking of joy (fun, excitement, interest, intimacy) and the expression/exemplification of love/compassion is safe, good, constructive and unconflicting.</p>
<p>And then you arrive at intrinsically wholehearted, heartfelt, affinity-feeling, pleasurable and rewarding and satisfying [and non-naive, competent, strategic and error-correcting] altruism/compassion/love [that truly expects no personal gain in return and only hopes for something truly good and experientially good for the other person] that’s romantic, paternal, maternal, egalitarian, platonic, and globally inclusive, that nevertheless delivers equal or greater personal safety/fulfillment/everything than selfish[ly-oriented] planning/intention/behavior. [You may find that there’s nothing that you can securely or permanently or stably hold onto for yourself, anyway, that there even is anything to hold onto, anyway.]</p>
<p>There is no end-state, though. Eventually you perhaps become the practice and it just goes by itself, in activity and rest/alone-time, but then you keep going, improving, learning, learning how to learn, proactively learning, proactively living, living your life, etc.</p>
<h2>Other practices (draft)</h2>
<p>If you have the time and money, I don’t know, maybe find a good therapist (one in 1000-10,000), go get therapy or psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>If your friends are into interesting practices, go explore with them.</p>
<p>Everything can be integrated. Live your life, have all the experiences (as makes sense), read all the books. Learn all the options and the degrees of freedom. The practices in this document are intended to both be load-bearing and to fill in the cracks when something better isn’t available.</p>
<p>There’s some narrow sense in which these practices can “do it all,” get someone all the meditation-y goodness, heal trauma, alter preferences and behavior, increase wisdom, increase moral intelligence. These practices are ideally an absolute bootstrapping foundation that can fill in any missing cracks. It can be worth it to clocks thousands and thousands and thousands of hours on these practices alone. It can be worth it to be narrowly hardcore with these practices.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Use everything. Use all of it. There’s better and worse, and choices matter, but, ultimately, late-stage, end-game, there’s no relevant distinction these practices, any other practices, and life itself.</p>
<p>Lots of solo time is needed, and sometimes solo time is the only thing available, but someone who’s having a rich variety of experiences with a rich variety of compassionate, intelligent, interesting people will progress (possibly) faster (and possibly more safely), all things being equal.</p></div>
