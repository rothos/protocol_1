<h3>Catch-all/alpha/beta/draft disclaimer</h3>
<p>I make many bold assertions in this document, and sometimes I use words like usually, often, etc., that may seem to imply I’m working from a large dataset. Please understand that the protocol has been most heavily tested by me, with a very small additional number of people who are using the protocol either heavily or at least semi-consistently. More and more people are trying this thing out as it becomes more widely known. But, we don’t have a lot of data, and, when I make bold claims, I’m extrapolating from everything I know, which will at minimum be many, many things adjacent to the protocol but not necessarily derived from empirical use of the protocol by other people, and in a very small number of cases, even myself. But, for what it’s worth, I eat my own dog food as it were. The protocol has been my sole transformative practice for thousands of hours, and I’ve tried extensively to suss out all former prerequisites and to incorporate them into the practice. And I’m tracking some of the users very carefully. I currently believe other people besides myself can use this thing to take themselves all the way.</p>

<h2>Preamble (draft!)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Remember, you’re probably going to die. Remember that the universe may experience heat death. Remember that, in some sense, death and heat death are in some sense just ideas and concepts.</li>
<li>Remember that, while no one is obligated to give you or help you get these things, you deserve happiness, health, enjoyment, love, sex, family, and more.</li>
<li>Remember, in the relevant sense, you are the sole and final arbiter of what’s true, good, and beautiful. Feel what you feel. Do what you do. And, again, I think Crowley got something right, here, in the relevant sense (and possibly other things, too; i just haven’t investigated): Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love under will. (or something)</li>

<li>If you are at risk from sequelae of high blood pressure, intracranial pressure, or intraocular pressure (e.g. stroke, dissection, glaucoma), then you must not engage with the practices below or you must engage with them with extreme caution. If you have spinal or cervical abnormalities that could lead to spinal cord or nerve root impingement, then you must not engage with the practices below or you must engage with them with extreme caution. If you have other musculoskeletal risks then you must be careful.</li>
<li>Individuals residing in households with other residents below the age of eighteen or over the age of 65 should not engage in these practices after practice has been initiated, unless there is no one under the age of eighteen in the household and anyone over the age of 65 has consented to your doing these practices in residence after they’ve read this numbered list.</li>
<li>Women who are pregnant or you might become pregnant before asymptoting in these practices (e.g. 2-10 years, depending) should not engage in these practices.</li>
<li>If you are at risk for suicide, psychosis, or mania then you should engage with these practices with extreme caution.</li>
<li>If you have metabolic or cardiovascular disease such that a prolonged, inadvertent sedentary lifestyle (no exercise because of musculoskeletal sequelae) would be dangerous, then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If your immune system is under- or overactive, then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If you have experience abuse, psychological trauma, physical trauma, etc., then you should engage with these practices with caution.</li>
<li>If you engage with these practices then you must be aware that you could permanently ruin the rest of your life or die (sooner than you would otherwise). You must also be aware that the lives of people around you may be ruined or those people may die sooner as a result of your engaging these practices.</li>

</ol>
<h2>An exoteric doctrine (v0.2)</h2>
<p>Objective and singular truth exists (and/or objective reality exists and objective truth corresponds to it).</p>
<p>Objective and singular goodness(/ethics/morality) exists.</p>
<p>The human mind is typically confused, uncertain, and ignorant. (Or, a typical person is…)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can know typically error-prone approximations of that objective truth and we can know/do approximations of that objective goodness.</p>
<p>Further, the human mind is asymptotically perfectible. That is, we can become better people in a practically unlimited way, all things being equal.</p>
<p>???There are more worse ways than better ways to interact with oneself and others.</p>
<p>In any moment you are the final arbiter of what’s true and good. You have to trust yourself while also being open to being wrong. This is hard but can get easier.</p>
<p>It’s possible to do more harm than good when trying or intending to do good and become better. (Also, you are the final arbiter of what’s better.)</p>
<p>Using systematic (albeit self-adapted) method is often or at least sometimes a good way to improve one’s approximations of truth and goodness. Stated alternatively, we can systematically seek to get the things we want and we can systematically come have better wants (want better things).</p>
<p>Some methods are better than others, depending on what you’re trying to do, such as knowing and doing better.</p>
<p>We want what we want until we want something else, and it’s ok or good to want what we want for as long as we want it.</p>
<p>Perhaps evil or malevolence is objective but things are only bad relative to your skill, power, and knowledge. Perfectibility (asymptotically) includes solving all your problems on your terms, in your words, until there is nothing left that is bad.</p>
<p>You might not feel good and safe all the time, but it’s good to want to feel good and safe, and it’s good to seek to stably feel good and safe or to feel good and safe as much as possible.</p>
<p>Without exception, and no matter how subtle the feeling, there’s always a valid sense in which, if it feels wrong it is wrong. [i.e. if X makes you feel wrong, then X is somehow wrong.] People often will systematically and relentlessly deny the relevant sense in order to try to immorally coerce and control you. Senses other than the relevant sense can be used to inappropriately destroy institutions. People trying to control you will try to convince you the former is the latter (among an unlimited number of other tactics that don’t refer to groups or institutions.) Of course, you could be mistaken about something or both could be happening. But that’s what the controlling people will do.</p>
<p>You might get hit by a bus or meteor or your cryo chamber might run out of geopolitics or something. But, it’s possible to have a good life, anyway, and it’s possible to impeccably work to reduce the chances of such bad things while having a good, complete, rich, full, life.</p>
<p>Most people will probably be happier striving for and maintaining a stable romantic pair-bond and having one or more kids.</p>
<p>Love properly labeled and defined is probably a uniquely important thing.</p>
<p>Some truths are exceptionless/universal and eternal or sempiternal or timeless or outside-of-time or something. With correct method, you can know those truths by making use of whatever experiences you’ve already had (because those truths will massively redundantly inhere in those experiences without exception.) Some truths and knowledge of correct/good/moral knowledge/behavior are contingent (or relative to, or contextually dependent on, this world and time and place) and, to obtain them, you’ll need to dispel ignorance, to have experiences, to learn. You’ll be wrong and bad a lot. Also, you are good.</p>
<p>Progress is often multidimensionally nonmonotonic.</p>
<p>These are just words. This is just your interpretation of these words. Are there even words? You can’t know anything for sure; and that can be ok, with application of method or just because. There are more precise and accurate and deeper and more correct ways ways to say all the above.
More and more and more of everyone may come together to do good things that we couldn’t do alone.
Sometimes, an edgy joke should go here.
Let go…</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the absence of maintaining a quality introduction across releases, though that is a thing that needs to happen eventually or soon, here are comments by Jonathan, and edited text discussions with Jonathan, included with permission:</p>
<p>[Some of the edits change the original meaning a bit while still making the same point.]</p>
<h3>Excerpt I</h3>
<p><strong>Jonathan [9:11 PM][Ed: 2019-04-11; 21:32 PDT]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>a couple more things that come to mind maybe for future versions. excuse the ramble-i-ness</p>
<p>do you think it could be useful/important to table set a little bit? something along the lines of (but not necessarily this, just something in this direction): this will likely feel different from previous meditation you’ve done, if you’ve done some. i think past versions had something like this. and kind of for the reason I mentioned in […]: I could see people spending a fair amount of time trying to shoehorn this practice into their prior conception of what meditation practice is. i guess p2, p8, and p1 stand a good chance of addressing this directly without it having to be written out. i wonder how useful or not some making this explicit would be. :thinking_face:</p>
<p>and i also wonder if there’s some basic basic theory of mind that is good to mention right off-the-bat. it may very well not be a good thing, i’m not sure. here’s the kind of theory that might be good imo, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there’s like some kind of universal gradient/basin/attractor that the mind/brain is always, always, alway, always trying to fall down. one single direction, which might be why correct meditation works elegance, free energy minimization, dunno</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how the mind is really smart in some ways, sometimes/often moreso than the “personality” (i might be butchering the thing but that’s how i remember it)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and lots of little related things like this</p>
<p>for example wrt to the above, knowing stuff like this has made it easier for me to trust that the right things are happening at times, or trust that my mind can do good things, and stuff like that. depending on the models of mind people are running on i could expect there to be a lot of self fighting and self flailing and not self trusting in ways that might be bad. for example, if you’re coming from a tmi practice you might believe that your mind is this thing you need to wrangle, that you know better than, stuff like that. little bits of theory like this could help people understand how the practice works, why it’s different than practice they’ve done before, and possibly have the needed faith to try it out for 100+ hours</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Excerpt II</h3>
<p><strong>Jonathan [4:32 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way I've been orienting to [this protocol versus other meditation protocols] myself recently is not through the meditation frame (though it is that and becomes that feel again eventually) but through the "going all the way to the bottom and from first principles as it were figuring out how to use a mind" frame, or something in the ballpark of that (edited)</p>
<p>It just cuts through a lot of the "is this meditation", or "am I doing the right thing" stuff, if you forget about meditation for a couple months and pretend it's not that, or something  (At least in my experience)</p>
<p>I guess this is a bit of a tangent now</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [5:15 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cool. It is really different than [other] meditation [procedures] in a lot of ways. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [6:46 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah. i definitely think it is meditation. i'm probably being critically unappreciative, but there's a way in which other meditations are more narrow/constrained and this stuff is still meditation but wholeheartedly takes on the whole mind and every part of it. maybe it's all the same in the limit or something.</p>
<p>the concern is that i think i probably spent something like 50 - 100 hours (total total total total total ballpark) trying to make [this protocol into] what i understood to be meditation, or at least hours where this was on my mind and undermining practice, in a way. and even afterwards there have been and has been threads in my mind like "huh this doesn't feel like meditation so i must be doing something wrong". of course i think a lot of this is par for the course and part of tacking towards good and tacking towards better models of mind and meditation. like why does it feel wrong? why is one thing more meditation than another? but maybe with the right upfront expectation setting there's a way to just nip the shoehorning in a bud and save people time (edited)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:00 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>trying to make this what i understood to be meditation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how does that look? can you say more? want to innoculate (and i'm sorry)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:03 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so after like n years knowing about tmi and noting and related practices, i had implicit models about how meditation works. the general general shape of the model was something like: your mind is a tool/machine, and you need to make it sensitive tool/machine such that one day it can finally pick up on some details of experience that lead to insight. step 1) develop powerful tool [powerful experienced as stable in the case of tmi, and perceptive in the case of noting]. step 2) use tool to examine reality</p>
<p>importantly nowhere in this model was there a sense that meaningful progress was being made up until the point of insight (edited)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so like train tool/build microscope, then use microscope? does that simplify it too much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>nope that's pretty much exactly it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>hmm k</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i'm guessing this is common, but i'm not positive</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think ingram sort of implies this</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and there was a model for what made a good microscope too</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Mark [8:05 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>like if you just use your microscope enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Jonathan [8:06 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think it was the model of what i thought made a good miscroscope that was especially problematic</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:06 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so then ppl like spend 1000 hours examining the blobs behind their closed eyes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think it was the model of what i thought made a good miscroscope that was especially problematic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>say more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:07 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sure. and eventually we should try to figure out why it is possible to have success with that metaphor. like, is it success in spite of the misconception? or is something else happening? [and ofc not everyone does have success and stuff]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong> Mark [8:07 PM] </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>like, is it success in spite of the misconception?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i currently think so</p>
<p>noting is close enough that people can slip into doing the right thing, especially with a teacher who succeeded</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:08 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so as mentioned with both noting and concentration, even tho the skills are different, what a successful microscope looks like in both cases involves something in the ballpark of mindfulness or "with it ness"</p>
<p>"with it ness" that builds up into long interrupted stretches of "with it ness" over time</p>
<p>and so if you're doing one of these practices it's getting into one of these stretches that makes it feel like you're finally doing it right</p>
<p>"fuck, i'm really with the breath." or "fuck, i'm really with these vibrations"</p>
<p>something about sustained continuity of a thing over time seems to be the thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:09 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so like almost indiscriminately maxing out continuous contact with bare sensations, sort of?</p>
<p>i guess that's what you said</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah yeah that's in there too</p>
<p>and with this stuff, it doesn't seem like striving for uniterruptedness is important (until it happens on it's own), and it seems like there's plenty of room for non purely sense stuff too</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(noting that i myself thought exactly all of this. pretty much exactly.)</p>
<p>yeah</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:10 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and so it didn't really feel like i was developing a microscope</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:11 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ah, ok</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jonathan [8:11 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah. even people who ahven't meditated before often have a model as it being about "no thinking", or "staying with the present"-ness
all of [that] is distinct from [this protocol]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(noting that i myself thought exactly all of this. pretty much exactly.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh cool! affirming yay</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark [8:12 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yup</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Excerpt III</h3>
<p><strong>Jonathan [10:24 PM]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually I just kind of remembered something funny. I remember at SFDC in the fall with Shinzen, you were telling [S] and I something like, "I think the updates that happen leading up to streamentry are as important as streamentry". And I remember internally thinking: "what do you mean updates before streamentry??" In quite a literal sense I thought streamentry was like a single belief toggling from off to on (preceded by no updates of significance).</p>
<p>I think this sort of all or nothing thinking is quite common.</p>
<p>[… I]t also bounced off in the most important way because I had no mental model of how practice could work that would have being patient, locally-oriented, not obsessed with the supramundane as being the correct strategy. The reaction was something like, "ok […] that's very cool […] but there's still this streamentry insight waiting for me out there and nothing will be good until that"</p>
<p>So yeah, in many ways, I think for many meditators and nonmeditators, a very big update will be that updates happen along the way and the mind gets better and more liveable along the way. and what a relieving update too. being super explicit and not at all sidelining this (as you're doing) will go a long way to that end.</p>
<p>For this all to work, for the claim that updates happen along the way to be credible, one need's a place for those updates [i.e. mundane insights] to live.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I'm sure all of [other] teachers would claim that "things are supposed to get better along the way, and if they're not, you're missing the point." But I blame their implied models of mind and implied models of progress! You can claim that "things are supposed to get better along the way" but if you're not providing the right model of mind/progress or otherwise really really emphasizing it, it's just going to bounce out of students brains and sound like hollow wishful thinking or something. So in summary heh: good models of mind and progress are super duper helpful and consequential to practice</p>

<h2>Text interpretation</h2>
<p>There’s an ongoing project of collecting all the reasons why people bounce off of the document, plus corresponding supplementary information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The document does require text interpretation. Even if it was written in clean, grammatical prose, it would still need to be incrementally parsed and interpreted. It does need to be studied. Lengthy explanations would lose the “cutting at the joints,” in the document, where every word is included for a reason. Eventually, I do want there to be a softer entry. But that might be separate from the document itself. This does mean there are “startup costs” and initial cognitive overhead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main practices do need to be learned incrementally. It’s not possible to just pick them up and start doing them. Even after one can “hold an entire practice in their head,” the doing of it will still evolve substantially over time. So, there is additional cognitive overhead and a learning curve or even learning cliff, here, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main practices might initially seem not like meditation. But, they do asymptote at something that superficially looks like noting practice and shamatha without support. But, this is approached in a bottom up way, as opposed to a top-down way. (As a longer discussion, I currently think canonical concentration practices as well as things like metta being used as a concentration practice, are ultimately counterproductive, because their top-down nature sends a person off sharply on a direction that hasn’t been properly error-checked. And, I currently believe a person will have to do a lot of backtracking, given my understanding and experience of how the mind works.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the auxilliary/preliminary practices might seem suspiciously non-meditationy, like cognitive behavioral therapy or something. One of my goals was to combine the best of “western depth psychology” with the best of meditation. Lots of meditation practioners and teachers do have crushed or unresolved trauma and behavioral issues. The so-called “purifications” do a bunch of the work of western psychology, but they don’t go all the way, hence the somatic issues, sex scandals, and behavioral blindspots of lots of meditators. One can think of this practice as supercharging the purifications, making them much more comprehensive and thorough. At the same time, the practices do produce an experience of emptiness, and, asymptotically, nonduality. These practices go all the way to the very end, and then some.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My current best estimate is that these practices, even taking into account learning time, achieve various “classical milestones” about an order of magnitude faster than traditional practices. I’m still working this out. And, I expect speed gains and payoffs continue to accrue cumulatively and compoundingly. We shall see. In any case, this does continue to be an investment of thousands of hours. And, some payoffs come late in the game, while some payoffs to occur steadily. And there are still risks to be worked out and improved upon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Goal (draft)</h2>
<p>The goal of the practice is to have a good life, in the most broad and ordinary sense, on your terms, in your words, in your frame, or in no frame. That might look still, quiet, and intimate. That might look big and beautiful. (That might or might not include a good death.) That might look superficially normative and be quite nonnormative under the hood and in the cracks. Or that might quite normative in lots of ways. But the important thing is that it is good for and everyone you care about (which might be no one, everyone, etc.). It might end too soon or go on too long or who knows. In some sense you might fail: Maybe you or people you care about will get hit by a bus, a heart attack, a meteor, or a nuclear war. But the goal is to have a good (peaceful, interesting, exciting, fun, intimate, quiet, safe, stable, normal, extraordinary) life. That’s the point of all of this. (Asymptotically, nonmonotonically approaching self-perfection might be an interesting, fun, mediately traumatizing, opportunity-costly, incidental side effect.)</p>
<p>Part of having a good life is preparing and accounting for (the likely possibility of) death such that you actually have a good life. One can have a dispreference for death, while not fearing it, while competently and proactively avoiding it, while seamlessly having that be a part of everything else that is good.</p>
<p>One might have to give up everything in the pursuit of this goal, strangely, weirdly, even as lots of things stay superficially the same. In some ways getting everything you want will first cost you everything, will cost you your entire world, as you realize what you want is nothing like what you initially thought, that reality is nothing like what you initially thought, even though what you want appears superficially similar, in some ways, to what you previously wanted.</p>
<p>You get the good stuff back eventually, though.</p>
<p>“Better not to start. If you start, better to finish.”</p>
<p>“Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”</p>
<p>“Before practice, the mountains were just mountains. During practice, the mountains were no longer mountains. Eventually, the mountains were just mountains again.”</p>
<p>Your perception, behavior, ontology, judgments, and preferences get refactored, with lots of mistakes made along the way. Thousands of hours. Lots of opportunity cost. Also lots of opportunity gain. All things being equal, with enough starting resources (financial, relationships) and grace.</p>
<h2>End state (draft!)</h2>
<p>The end state is arrived at asymptotically. There’s always room for improvement because the world keeps changing. The journey will often be nonmonotonic, too.</p>
<p>In any case, what it sort of looks like is coming to be intrinsically motivated to optimize self and world, seamlessly, without limit or exception, to care for everything into the infinite future, including yourself, all together, all at once. (This comes with something like “getting lost in the intrinsically interesting whole-person intricacies of other people.”)</p>
<p>Being this way, all the way down to the core of your being, sort of cleanly solves all your problems in the moment and in the limit. [“Infinity” is just a concept, etc., etc. Don’t take refuge in your interpretation of these words. Let it all go.]</p>
<p>Another way to express this is “true (global) total (maximum) positive sum with no negative externalities.”</p>
<p>Another way to express this is “embodying a perfectly unified, eternal, sempiternal, and exceptionless will that’s going after the most good and best thing for everybody and everything, including yourself, without compromise or exception, all at once.</p>
<p>One comes to see that there are no terrible, hard truths and no terrible, hard tradeoffs.</p>
<p>One comes to know deeply that, if something feels or seems wrong, no matter how subtle, still, small, and quiet, then something is wrong, somewhere, and it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>You have to feel and listen, eventually, ultimately, to each, every, and all still, small, and quiet voice:</p>
<p>“If you’re good to them, then they’ll become good you.”</p>
<p>All of the above is not “turiya” or “nonduality,” but it is compatible with that “stateless state.”</p>
<p>Progressive insight into emptiness unlocks the capacity for turiya and the capacity for all the above. And progress towards turiya is usually progress towards all the above, and vice versa. Using the practices in this document will steadily, albeit nonmonotonically, move you towards all of this. You’ll incidentally get all the meditation-y goodness, too, without having to do anything special.</p>
<p>You will get all the meditation-y goodness, in addition to everything else (which I suspect was the goal of many non-modern-Buddhist systems).</p>
<p>You’ll be aiming at and asymptotically, nonmonotonically arriving at “mastery”/“perfection”/“flawlessness”.</p>
<p>There’s a final, additional piece which completes of all of this, that’s something like “proactive recursive bootstrapping,” progressively structuring self and world to learn about self and world more and more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>Again, working with the practices in this document are intended to efficiently take you towards everything above.</p>
<p>A failure mode is trying to smash yourself into being what you think all the above must be like, by trying to directly aim at preconceived notions. If you don’t do all this “bottom up,” then you’ll tie yourself in knots.</p>
<p>The better thing to do is to <em>go after what you want,</em> systematically and iteratively resolving or correcting internal conflict and contradiction and error (with respect to goodness, truth, will, desire, etc., etc., etc.) along the way, and you’ll likely eventually find yourself in the neighborhood of something like what’s described, here. It will eventually be unified and elegant and a simplicity on the far side of complexity and not overwhelming or scattering or impossible. That’s what solving the puzzle box of the mind does. And it will be fun, meaningful, interesting, equanimous, captivating, loving, intimate, exciting, erotic, whatever.</p>
<p>Remember, in the relevant sense, you are the sole and final arbiter of what’s true, good, and beautiful. Feel what you feel. Do what you do. And, again, I think Crowley got something right, here, in the relevant sense (and possibly other things, too; i just haven’t investigated):</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love under will. (or something)</p>
<p>A key insight: If you know you’re doing the absolute best you can at all times in each moment, taking into account all future times and all possible futures deep down in your bones, then you just relax and let go, and it feels good.</p>
<p>Related: You can stop checking, compensating, reminding, self-correcting, etc., if you know both that you’re up to date and also that you’ll responsively and seamlessly update in the presence of new information.</p>
<p>The “good for everyone all at once thing” is equivalent to solving all of your problems.</p>
<p>[For everything above, don’t take refuge in your interpretation of these words, or, if you do, hold it lightly. Let it all go. Let it all go to get the real thing back, later, in the right way, beyond your current conception. This is all just words. The whole document is just words. You must find your own truth or lack thereof, meaning or meaninglessness.]</p>
<p>Said one more time, the goal and the end-state (cf. wisdom, mastery, compassion, love, altruism):</p>
<p>The goal is to arrange self, life, and the entire world so that the guiltless seeking of joy (fun, excitement, interest, intimacy) and the expression/exemplification of love/compassion is safe, good, constructive and unconflicting.</p>
<p>And then you arrive at intrinsically wholehearted, heartfelt, affinity-feeling, pleasurable and rewarding and satisfying [and non-naive, competent, strategic and error-correcting] altruism/compassion/love [that truly expects no personal gain in return and only hopes for something truly good and experientially good for the other person] that’s romantic, paternal, maternal, egalitarian, platonic, and globally inclusive, that nevertheless delivers equal or greater personal safety/fulfillment/everything than selfish[ly-oriented] planning/intention/behavior. [You may find that there’s nothing that you can securely or permanently or stably hold onto for yourself, anyway, that there even is anything to hold onto, anyway.]</p>
<p>There is no end-state, though. Eventually you perhaps become the practice and it just goes by itself, in activity and rest/alone-time, but then you keep going, improving, learning, learning how to learn, proactively learning, proactively living, living your life, etc.</p>
<h2>Other practices (draft)</h2>
<p>If you have the time and money, I don’t know, maybe find a good therapist (one in 1000-10,000), go get therapy or psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>If your friends are into interesting practices, go explore with them.</p>
<p>Everything can be integrated. Live your life, have all the experiences (as makes sense), read all the books. Learn all the options and the degrees of freedom. The practices in this document are intended to both be load-bearing and to fill in the cracks when something better isn’t available.</p>
<p>There’s some narrow sense in which these practices can “do it all,” get someone all the meditation-y goodness, heal trauma, alter preferences and behavior, increase wisdom, increase moral intelligence. These practices are ideally an absolute bootstrapping foundation that can fill in any missing cracks. It can be worth it to clocks thousands and thousands and thousands of hours on these practices alone. It can be worth it to be narrowly hardcore with these practices.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Use everything. Use all of it. There’s better and worse, and choices matter, but, ultimately, late-stage, end-game, there’s no relevant distinction these practices, any other practices, and life itself.</p>
<p>Lots of solo time is needed, and sometimes solo time is the only thing available, but someone who’s having a rich variety of experiences with a rich variety of compassionate, intelligent, interesting people will progress (possibly) faster (and possibly more safely), all things being equal.</p>
<h2>Culture and community</h2>
<h3>Evil</h3>
<h4>I: Introduction</h4>
<p>If you start doing work on yourself, you’ll become more sensitive to a lot of things. And that sensitivity, initially, can make you more vulnerable to bad things than you’d otherwise be. That sensitivity can also make you become a more dangerous or harmful person to be around, initially. Over time, asymptotically, nonmonotonically, what you were vulnerable to, what used to influence you or cause disendorsed changes to you, becomes just information. And this information can be used to enhance safety for self and others. And your sensitivity and responsiveness, from ongoing meditation, and the knowledge that’s easier to acquire because of that sensitivity and responsiveness, can make you safer and safer for other people.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may more often find yourself in communities of practice, as you explore things like meditation, energy work, shamanism, or whatever. Communities of practice sometimes have coercive things “in the air,” and sometimes communities of practice contain, or have adjacent, “dark wizards,” and sometimes they are created, run, influenced, or ruled by “cult leaders.”</p>
<p>Reading the sections below may help to minimize risks to self and others, in relation and in community.</p>
<h4>II: A brief layer model of mind, personality, groups, and (global) culture</h4>
<p>Consider the mind to be made up of a large number of parallel (information) flows, or pipes, or tubes.</p>
<p>Countless numbers of these tubes all happening, all at once, is you.</p>
<p>Sensory information goes in one end of a tube (sensation) and immune system, hormonal, glandular, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle activity goes out the other end of a tube (actuation).</p>
<p>Tubes can be short and long.</p>
<p>A short tube goes from input to output, sensation to actuation, in a small number of milliseconds.</p>
<p>A long tube goes from input to output, sensation to actuation, taking hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
<p>In addition to normal input (sensory information; sensation), some tubes can incorporate information from other tubes prior to termination (actuation). And, in addition to normal termination (skeletal muscle, etc.; actuation), some tubes pass information to other tubes. Information transfer happens at junctions. [Note that this theory doesn’t have any “fully internal tubes” or tubes that are “sensation+internal” or “internal+actuation.” A future theory might need to allow for this.]</p>
<p>When tubes pass information to other tubes, (internal) loops/cycles can form.</p>
<p>There is a shortest possible length of tube.</p>
<p>There is a shortest possible length of loop.</p>
<p>Below a particular tube length, there can’t be any loops.</p>
<p>Sensation alters tube lengths and junctures. (And actuation influences sensation.)</p>
<p>Some tubes pass through awareness. These are awareness tubes. If those tubes happen to have junctures with other tubes, then we can experience the sensations passing through those other tubes. (And, we can participate in our actuations via external loops.)</p>
<p>Tubes that happen to have junctures with awareness tubes are called junctured awareness tubes. Some tube lengths and junctures can only be modified or created when the relevant tubes are currently junctured awareness tubes.</p>
<p>When junctured awareness tubes are very short and contain no loops, then there is no self-experience, and “in the seeing there is just the seen,” “in the hearing there is just the heard,” “in the feeling there is just the felt,” “in the doing, just doing,” etc. There is just “what it feels like.”</p>
<p>When there are loops in or proximal to junctured awareness tubes then there is self-experience. There is, partially, “what it feels like to be you.”</p>
<p>Countless tubes at any given time are junctured awareness tubes, but most tubes at any given time are not junctured awareness tubes.</p>
<p>When loops are minimized there cannot be contention or compensation.</p>
<p>When loops are minimized there cannot be improperly reified concepts.</p>
<p>A state of minimal loops is primordial or natural (though not necessarily ordinary).</p>
<p>The minimization of loops correlates with but does not guarantee constructive, good behavior. The minimization of loops correlates with but does not guarantee the absence of destructive, bad, unskillful, and evil behavior.</p>
<p>Contention can cause ill-health, accelerated aging, excessive actuation, and suffering.</p>
<p>Contention in junctured awareness tubes is experienced as logical contradiction and (sometimes extremely subtle) muscle tension.</p>
<p>Compensation can be locally elegant but is globally inelegant.</p>
<p>If someone has a problem, a loopless solution to that problem will not have any compensation. A non-loopless solution will have compensation. Compensatory solutions are much easier to find than loopless solutions. Loopless solutions are minimally costly in the limit. Compensatory solutions are locally costly. The greater the accumulated cost, the harder it is to find additional solutions. The lower the accumulated cost, the easier it is to find additional solutions, though the solution-finding process may still be lengthy.</p>
<p>An example of compensation is “I’m doing X which is bad but if I also do Y then it will cancel the bad effects of X.”</p>
<p>Compensation is usually not perfect and so begets further compensation. An example of this is “I’m doing Y to compensate for X but Y creates a further problem Z so I must do R to compensate for Z but R also has a problem…”</p>
<p>Compensation is fractally self-similar. That is, micro-compensation produces larger-scale patterns of compensation. Examples of larger-scale patterns are tics, neuroses, hangups, blindspots, personality disorders, etc.</p>
<p>Compensation can produce occlusion. Occlusion is when tubes are not and cannot easily or quickly become junctured awareness tubes.</p>
<p>Large-scale compensation and occlusion produces personality layers. If experience happens too quickly, too surprisingly, or too traumatically than personality layers are more likely to form.</p>
<p>So, someone can have childhood confusions or uncertainties or inabilities and/or (by defintion unhealed) hurts and traumas, and, on top of those, have adult-style regulation. (That adult-style regulation will be crippled in many ways because of the excessive cost of compensation. That person might read lots of books on e.g. relationships, but, without delayering, their relating might remain laborious and “unnatural.”)</p>
<p>Because of mimesis, love, power, and technology, compensation and layering can extend to groups, cultures, and society. There are global-scale cultural layers, in part produced through famine, colonization, war, etc., as well as locally adaptive but globally maladaptive traditions of child-rearing, etc.</p>
<p>Individual and group practice can de-layer and de-compensate, solving problems without the use of compensation, until individuals, and even communities, or larger, are relatively natural. Again, compensation is necessary and adaptive. And naturalization only guarantees a subset of good things, with opportunity costs. It is only better, all (other) things being equal.</p>
<h4>III: The blooming, buzzing confusion</h4>
<p>Layering and occlusion can make it very hard to turn tubes into junctured awareness tubes. But, sensation and actuation, the inputs and outputs of tubes can’t be blocked. Sensation is always happening for all of a person’s tubes, at every layer. And actuation is always happening at the termination of every tube.</p>
<p>If an adult has childhood confusions or uncertainties or inabilities and/or (by defintion unhealed) hurts and traumas in their system, then this can be problematic because that childhood self can be triggered. And then that person’s behavior, in a particular situation, will have behaviors reminiscient of childhood, which can be inappropriate, maladaptive, or dangerous to relationships or livelihood. So this must be carefully managed.</p>
<p>A person manages always-triggerable lower layers by reducing the scope of their lives (never entering particular situations), creating controlled situations (only entering situations that they themselves have carefully prearranged), managing attention in situations (carefully using actuation to manage the sensation stream), or arranging temporary compensatory sinks (teeth-gritting, white-knuckling, stomach-clenching, etc.). [An alternative, of course, if resources are available, is to take the time to naturalize layer after layer, to find noncompensatory solutions and thereby widening the scope of life.]</p>
<p>A person will have learned to manage some of their lower layers. But, typically, many layers (and “pockets”) will not be well-managed. A further complication is that lower layers, while not always, tend to be occluded and so can be affected outside of awareness and those effects may be hard to infer from downstream, ramified experiences. In short, it’s possible for vulnerable lower layers to become traumatized or further traumatized.</p>
<p>It gets worse in that everyone, at all layers have both functional ontologies as well as remaining blooming, buzzing confusion (as per William James). That is, everyone has patterns of input that can produce hard to predict effects in the system. This is a further dimension of vulnerabilitiy.</p>
<p>To explain further, when we were at our youngest, while we have genetic predisposition towards certain types of interpretations, the world doesn’t come pre-given. We have to assemble feeling, sound, light, touch, etc., into appearances, inferred objects, causal relations, and proactive management of self and environment. Prior to this, and always alongside this, there is blooming, buzzing confusion. There is “static,” “noise” lining the edges of experience and even shot through all of experience, the “feel of reality.”</p>
<h4>IV: The demon-haunted world and science as a candle in the dark (as per Carl Sagan)</h4>
<p>And, so, this static, this noise, this blur that colors everything, and it comes in layers, there is some at every layer—this is the domain of shamans, of magick, of the siddhis, of the powers.</p>
<p>Western and so-called “universal culture” has factored away much of this blur into legible ontologies and compenstory pockets.</p>
<p>But consider, childhood fears—monsters, ghosts, etc. Consider cultural and religious—demons, hells, etc. Consider childhood extremity—terror, loss of control, disregulation, bullying, abuse, violence, hatred.</p>
<p>Also consider, adult desperation around money, poverty, power, status, sex (coercive fantasy and actuality in kinks, fetishes, and paraphilias), intimacy, belongingness, health, aging, sickness, and death.</p>
<p>Consider the desperation of infant, child, adult to affect the mother, peers, adults, the powerful, and vice versa. Consider the childhood insecurities and fears still layered into the adult narcissist, the adult schizoid, the adult borderline.</p>
<p>Consider how desperately, out of love and fear, how desperately people are trying to affect each other all the time.</p>
<p>Consider that what the brain does is make sense of blooming, buzzing confusion, to find signal in noise. Consider as well that those vast number of tubes. Consider our sensitivity to transduce single photons. Consider facial expressions, flickering of the eyes, body language, voice tone, timbre and prosody. Consider temperature fluctuations in the air. Consider subtle changes in air currents as we move our limbs. Consider those vast degrees of freedom as well as that sensitivity. Consider the heights of skill of say olympic athletes versus weekly joggers.</p>
<p>And then is it any wonder that hapless creeps, dark wizards, cult leaders… and healers walk among us?</p>
<h4>V: Everyday blah, hapless creeps, dark wizards, and cult leaders</h4>
<p>The mind is vast and occlusion is a thing.</p>
<p>On the surface, most people genuinely and authentically want to be good to people and to be better people. Almost everyone has at least a little vicious hatred, or ill-will or at least just reckless terror at lower layers. Those negative things will typically be latent in lower layers. But they can be triggered under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>And, upon being triggered, negative behaviors, both gross and subtle, will feel <em>right</em>, <em>normal</em>, <em>appropriate</em>, <em>justified</em>. And then that person will do obvious or subtle bad things.</p>
<p>The obvious stuff is bad enough, from glaring to shouting or even hitting. But the subtle stuff can be really bad, too. It can be coercive, soul-damaging—it can create vulnerabilities which beget further harm.</p>
<p>We all do things we don’t endorse. We all can cause subtle harm. And, if we had adult abuse in our past, sometimes we can do harm “above our weight class,” and it’s very regretful.</p>
<p>The above few paragraphs describe the spectrum from everyday blah all the way to hapless creeps.</p>
<p>There is a worse level, which is that of the “dark wizard.” For the previous level, the ability to do harm is accumulated incidentally and unsystematically. But, a dark wizard systematically cultivates the ability to influence people. This can be either “deliberate and unreflective/accidental” or “deliberate and reflective.”</p>
<p>For the “deliberate and unreflective/accidental” category, a good example of this is in relation some kinks, fetishes, paraphilias (and also “vanilla-sexual”). Some kinks are pure fantasy, some involve “consensual nonconsent,” and some, usually disendorsed, involve the actualization of nonconsent, either incidentally or essentially.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of those cases can potentially produce unwanted effects in other people because, even for the pure fantasy cases, there can be “actualization bleed.” And often, people have lower-layer material/“tubes”/etc that want to realize some “actual nonconsent,” even if this is disendorsed by much else of the system. And even if this is compensated for at the higher layers. There can still be subtle, harmful effects between people via lower levels.</p>
<p>The situation is analogous for safety/control fantasies and revenge fantasies. (For the safety/control case, the person wants other people to behave in highly specific ways so that that person can feel safe. Often, this will be in childhood, parent-child, or religious ontologies.)</p>
<p>In all of these cases, sexual, control, revenge, the person is cultivating the thoughts, fantasies, beliefs, material, behaviors over time. There’s something building up over time and becoming more powerful, more effective, more insidious, even if unintentional.</p>
<p>It would be a much better world if people’s sexual fantasies stayed safely inside our heads, but unfortunately this isn’t always the case. And that’s pretty intense, but it seems to be true. The worst of this, here, is perhaps “community sexual predators” that are somehow “more effective or successful than they should be.”</p>
<p>Moving on from “deliberate and unreflective,” pickup artistrty (PUA), “business influence,” and “persuasion” type books are in a gray area between “unreflective” and “reflective.” The person is systematically cultivating <em>something</em> but the ontology is pretty intrisically low-key, relatively speaking, as compared to sexual stuff or what follows below.</p>
<p>In “deliberate and reflective” proper, these are people that are reading spellbooks or doing chaos magic or summoning demons or dabbling in curses and in any case deliberately seeking to influence people for personal gain. There are cringy and toothless versions of this, and there are very, very terrible versions of this. Remember, all of this has naturalistic explanations, but the layers of the mind reify things and we experience it as real. And it can drive up blood pressure and cause heart attacks and stroke, subtly or grossly reduce quality of life forever, drive people insane, tear communities apart, etc. And, all the while, there is gaslighting and self-gaslighting that that isn’t what’s happening.</p>
<p>Historically, and in some places contemporaneously, each village had a shaman to deal the intentional and unintentional, from blah to terrible, stuff happening between people and villages/tribes/etc.</p>
<p>Cult leaders will be discussed more below.</p>
<h4>VI: Spot the dark wizard</h4>
<p>A final note is that, if you’re trying to influence people at all, if you have any perceived <em>need</em> at all with respect to other people (belonging, care, money, intimacy, sex), unless you and everyone are in a tremendously high-resourced environment, and everyone is engaged in mutually creative synergy, then you’ve likely got at least some baby dark wizard going on, or some latent dark wizarding that could get triggered.</p>
<p>And if you’ve been cultivating, ruminating, working over, developing in/on/over anything that in some way involves thinking, other people, or influencing other people, then you’ve likely got something either full-on dark wizardy or something that could easily be converted over to dark-wizard-ness with the right push.</p>
<p>This section is not to normalize the above, though. (“Oh, he’s saying everyone is a dark wizard, ok, so it’s not that bad.”) This section is a warning. In other words, if you don’t think you can’t have “things that are that bad” in you, or you don’t think things in you will bleed out into the world, or you are “good at mind stuff” or “good at ethical interaction,” then you should probably be very careful. These are all surfaces areas for you to do unrelfective harm. And doing transformative practices can make things worse, in the short-term or for a long time.</p>
<p>If you see yourself as a helper or a healer, this is also a yellow flag. Often “helping” or “healing” can contain perversity, not just good but also harm. And the goodness makes it harder to see the harm.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to be ashamed of, here. Layering and misconceptualization or non-conceptualization mean that it can take time to find the bad stuff, sometimes years.</p>
<p>But given that it’s possible to hurt people in the meantime, one should be listen to people when they say you’re being weird, creepy, harmful, etc. (Sometimes it’s munchausen or gaslighting when people say they’re being harmed, but you have to do due diligence—it could be both partially not your responsibility and partially you doing harm. If you dismiss people’s concerns as not valid then that’s a red flag that you’re at least low-resourced and probably doing additional harm on top of the dismissal.)</p>
<p>You have to be ready to isolate yourself, to walk away, and sometimes you should let people excommunicate you. Sometimes, it will be the case that you were in an unhealthy environment, and you defending yourself is further hurting people around you. But “active” defenses mean you aren’t skilled enough yet. When the environment becomes “just information” as opposed to something that needs to be defended against then you can consider yourself skilled. At that point you won’t be “actively” hurting people in such an environment, but they could still experience your being there as harmful because of things in them that don’t want to be exposed, even passively via your side, to things in you. Sometimes it can take a very long time to figure out who’s doing or not doing what to whom, and it’s better to just not interact.</p>
<h4>VII: Healers</h4>
<p>Healers, bodyworkers, energy healers, reiki practioners, healing touch practitioners, qigong practitioners, exorcists, shamans, etc., can be great. Keep in mind that there is a vast range of skill. Some people are completely ineffectual. Some are very effective but cause both harm and good things at the same time. The rare individual with decades of (lineage?) training and experience is excellent. (And some “healers” are dependancy-inducing predators.)</p>
<p>Minds are vast, people have weird beliefs, and the mind makes it real. Healers work in different paradigms and so there can be ontology shear and effect shear. Healers might have different beliefs than you (and your mind) about what changes are good and bad, and when, and why, and how. Healers will have their own blindspots and malevolent layered intentions. Healers can sometimes pick up lots of bad stuff from people they’re trying to heal (or teachers that they’ve worked with) that they haven’t entirely cleared themselves. And then they can pass it on to you. And sometimes healers can have bad days where they’re mean and ill-willed.</p>
<p>If someone has been practicing for decades and you can talk to other people they’ve worked with who say good things, then they might be a good fit for you. If someone has seemingly produced miracles (they’ve gotten a stroke victim to walk again or otherwise given someone their life back) but they seem creepy to you, then it might be better to stay away. (Most reading this will not be in need of a miracle that they cannot ultimately produce themselves, possibly on a faster timeline with less resources.)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, for serious meditators, there are very quickly diminishing returns for working with healers. Meditation is essentially self-sufficient, self-healing that “goes all the way,” all things being equal. Sometimes a healer can get you out of a rut or help you deal with an acute issue. Often, maybe almost always, you’ll have to rework whatever they did, in the future. Maybe almost always, what healers do are just a temporary patch, for a serious meditator. (For non-meditators a “patch” can be life-saving. Just different needs for different life trajectories.) So, sometimes it’ll be net good and sometimes net bad.</p>
<h4>VIII: Witch hunts, vulnerabilitiy, contagion, tragedy of transformation, community decompensation</h4>
<p>It can be hard to assign blame and decide what to do. We all can have layered material that can be vulnerable in idiosyncratic ways. Someone can have a sex or revenge fantasy that they’re barely broadcasting, that wouldn’t affect 95% of people. But, when you’re in a room with them, it does awful stuff to your system. So who’s at fault? In this case mostly nobody, but there’s still the issue that you can’t be in a room with them. It might be both people’s responsibility to change. The person with the fantasy to figure out how it’s bleeding into the world a little bit. And you to figure out why it’s affecting you. But, for one or both of you, that could be hundreds of hours of work (though which will produce all sorts of collateral positive effects along the way), and one or both of you might not currently be systematic meditators.</p>
<p>It gets harder when the content is occluded—one person might be competely unaware that something is bleeding through or that it even exists. Or they might sort of know but reflexively gaslight that it isn’t happening. Or they might be very scared and angry that a) they might be hurting people or b) that their fantasy isn’t actually private.</p>
<p>To make things even more complicated, people can manufacture or play up harm. They can accuse people of not just being creepy but also being subtly harmful. And sometimes they’ll be right, but it will be low-grade harm, and sometimes they’ll be mistaken, but some part of them, reflectively or unreflectively wants it to be true because it would be convenient if it were true.</p>
<p>To make things even <em>more</em> complicated, often people who are vulnerable to what another person is doing will in some sense <em>want</em> to be affected, in part, by what the other person is doing. Usually what the other person is doing will have “good” parts and “bad” parts, and a person’s system will “unreflectively/subconsciously choose” to take the bad with the good, in order to get the good. This will usually be reflectively disendorsed—the “good thing” upon examination, will be confused, somehow—but can still, in some sense, be used to point to complicity on the part of the person being affected. [One way of becoming less vulnerable, by the way, is to make it safe to see what is or feels good about what’s happening, or the current thing in the system, and to find a healthier version of the attractive but disendorsed thing, which can replace the net bad package as well as the receptive surface.] In any case, often the seemingly good thing will in some way have been sculpted to have that attractiveness/temptation, and so on, to make it more likely that people will be hooked by it. And often the person who has the attractive/tempting thing will (at least eventually if not immediately) reflectively disendorse it being that way, too.</p>
<p>This is all very hard.</p>
<p>There is an additional phenomenon of people believing that they are protected by their rationality, reasonableness, belief in science, or strength of will. But, very often, such people will still be affected in occluded layers. And so their behavior will become more harmful, because they themselves have been harmed by something, but they will be resistant or unable to investigate this. And they might also further transfer bad things to other people; they might unknowingly pass bad stuff along. Such people are good candidates for interaction with a healer, if they agree to it.</p>
<p>Another problematic thing that can happen is, when someone becomes a systematic meditator, they can start decompensating in ways that influence occluded material. They might have cycles of increased desperation or neediness that bleeds through in problematic or intense ways. And people who are good-faith trying to become safer to be around, or just better people, can actually become more dangerous to be around for a period of time. This extends to communities as well. For a community of self-transformers, things can get much, much, much worse until things get better—lives can be ruined and communities can get torn apart, even as people just wanted to get better together. All the bad stuff can come out in insidious and explosive ways.</p>
<h4>IX: Timelines and stopgaps and sanity checks</h4>
<p>Part of what makes this so hard is how long the timelines are. Self-transformation takes thousands of hours, and people’s patterns of vulnerability to each other are idiosyncratic. So if harm is occurring, it can take dozens, hundreds, or thousands of hours to to sort out who’s doing what to whom and to fix it. And this is superexpontential the more people that are involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes people just need to stop associating, even if they were lovers, friends, or colleagues before starting to self-transform. And this can be tragic when a relationship or community has formed with the best of intentions. (But people do grow apart under “normal” conditions, too.)</p>
<p>Discussing all this stuff up front can help. Documents like this can help. Effective self-transformative practices like the ones in this document can help.</p>
<p>If one is exploring the many protocol with people (see further in the document), it can be helpful to start very, very slowly, maybe just five minutes per day for months, or to not do it at all with some combinations of people. Sometimes solo transformation only is a better choice for a community.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to just leave the room for five minutes, if something is going on, to metabolize it and maybe come back more resilient.</p>
<p>If you feel buzzing or tingling in your body, localized or not, or the air seems “thick” or “shimmery,” or the reality of the room seems to become “less,” that doesn’t mean something is bad is necesarily happening, but something is probably happening.</p>
<p>But remember the issues with witch hunts, manufactured victimhood, and determining harm. But also remember the reality of gaslighting. If something feels wrong, something is wrong, somewhere.</p>
<p>You can intend to know exactly what’s going on. And you can intend to have a solution that’s good-faith, good-will for everyone. Sometimes you’ll need to leave or have people leave. But hopefully you won’t. May the best thing happen for everyone.</p>
<h4>X: The late-stage meditator in community</h4>
<p>People often become more sensitive and more vulnerable at first, possibly for months or years. But eventually…</p>
<p>This is just a conceptual model. The reality of it <em>feels</em> different, maybe, sometimes. But the below is a good way to provisionally think about what happens for a late-stage meditator.</p>
<p>So the late-stage meditator is mostly de-layered, de-occluded. They have access to most of their stuff, and most of their stuff healed or grown up or a bit wiser. Two particular dimensions are important, here:</p>
<p>The first is the dimension of self-other confusions. We can pick up stuff from other people and think it’s ours, think that it is us. And this becomes actuation just like everything else in our system. That part of us literally thinks its an extension of the other person, it feels like the other person from the inside. Any part of us that’s a little bit confused about self versus other can acquire “otherness” at any point during our lives. Over time, the systematic meditator helps their parts realize who they belong to and to realize that they only have to be themselves. Those parts, all things being equal, become “invulnerable” to future otherwise potential incidents of self-other confusion.</p>
<p>(Remember, you’ll always be bathed in the stuff, all the time. But it becomes information instead of influence.)</p>
<p>The second dimension is that of goodness/badness inversions. Sometimes we think something is good when it’s actually bad and vice versa. And often it’s highly contingent and contextual as to whether something is good or bad. And some things can benefit one person at the expense of another. And childhood parts and layers can be quite confused or jumbled as to what’s good and bad, especially in cases of neglect and abuse but where that person was still dependent on an adult for love and protection. This can ramify as goodness/badness/self/other/boundary issues throughout a person’s system. A person is much more vulnerable to coercion when they believe something is good for them that is actually bad for them. They will “receive” material, content, intentions, will from another person to placate them, to be loved, all sorts of things, that might locally seem good to an occluded part is in fact terrible for the system as a whole. Over time, the late-stage meditator becomes wise and that wisdom percolates through the entire system. And, over time, the late-stage meditator is less and less likely to make local, perverse tradeoffs involving acceptance of ultimately unnecessary influence from other people.</p>
<p>So self/other confusions and good/bad inversions can be abstractly considered as the main sources or enablers of subtle interpersonal disendorsed effects.</p>
<p>(You may wish to temporarily skip to “XVI: The quiet interaction and the beauty of subtle interpersonal effects” before moving foward.)</p>
<h4>XI: Cult leaders</h4>
<p>Cult leaders are different. Anyone, including cult leaders, can change with luck and likely thousands of hours of work. But, a cult leader that’s a cult leader, right now, is different.</p>
<p>Bad things happened to them (very) early in life, or they responded to normal or bad early life things in particularly unfortunate ways. And then bad things accumulated on top of that. And now they are like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most people aren’t trying to affect <em>everybody</em> like they’ll be affecting “peers” or “potential lovers” or “direct competitive threats” or “people who are the object of my sexual fetish”. And it won’t be turned on all the time. But some people, e.g. cult leaders, want to “affect all humans all the time” in some way or some significant subset of that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all effects have “teeth” in that there could be a superstitious element, like, the person is “doing a thing” like wanting people to die or be angry, and people are picking that up, but it’s not actually causing people to do that thing. Cult leader stuff will have teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s an issue of “grain,” like people do have filters, but if someone is phenomenologically skilled (into meditation, spirituality, magic, etc.), in some literal sense a finer grain will get through people’s filters and affect them in ways that are too articulated for the average person’s system to manipulate and fix or much more likely at least “encyst”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people claim special knowledge or authority about truth, goodness, power, sex, intimacy, connection, minds. And those claims might not be legitimate, but if the other person’s system believes them that makes it much more likely transmission will occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, that seeming special knowledge about truth, goodness, power, meaning, etc., will in some way be instantiated in that person’s mind, but will usually be in some ways perverted, warped, or incomplete (even if seemingly clear, persuasive, attractive, and valuable). And prolonged contact with such a person can have a whole-mind warping effect, which would not be the case for someone who hadn’t developed such coherent-yet-still-perverse views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, some people are particularly schizoid or exquisitely walled off from the effects of sensations, somehow managing sensations such that they flow through a keyhole in order to preserve a fantasy reality of control, megalomania, (terror, fear), etc., sometimes hidden even from themselves. They might seem somewhat normal, if otherwise charismatic and/or creepy, but their minds will be arranged in a way that makes it very, very, very hard for them to responsively learn and grow, to understand the harm they’re causing and to all-the-way-down care about not hurting people or to realize, all the way down, that they’re even hurting people at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So charismatic cult leaders, or whatever, really are doing something especially bad.</p>
<p>If:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You find yourself tongue-tied, stupified, unable to argue with someone. And they’re charismatic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And/or they make you feel sometimes incredibly good and sometimes worthless, like you and your entire life and anything you’ve ever done or will ever do again is worthless. Or that they are the only way to get X.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if you do manage to argue, and they even don’t dismiss what you said, and even say it back to you in almost your own words, and it seems like they’re being reasonable, and something wrong still happens, you lose track of what you were going to say, or your “words get damaged,” and you still find yourself tongue-tied, stupified, or ultimately unable to argue with someone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, they might be a “cult leader.”</p>
<p>They might have a magnetic pull on a person’s entire mind/belief/representational/behavioral system that causes a person to start layering. This might produce value in some ways but also produces a net global cost for that person’s system (usually). Prolonged contact might mean years of cleanup and significantly increased self-transformation timelines.</p>
<p>They will present themselves (overtly or subtly) as having extremely rare, or unique, critically valuable special knowledge, but, usually it’s a lie or it’s not worth it because it’s mixed with poison and detoxing before consuming is prohibitively costly.</p>
<p>A good self-transformation technique will typically endogenously generate sufficient value such that subtly and overtly authoritarian and coercive individuals can be in some sense ignored, at least for the purposes of acquiring the most precious things.</p>
<p>(Such individuals will claim to have such techniques, and will dribble out some initial value, but engaging in such techniques will likely ultimately be damaging and counterproductive. If you decide to collect “pieces” from such people, beware. Sometimes they will have stumbled on a special, rare thing. But it will be perverted in some way and will come at a price.)</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate how much such an individual, one who, deep down, is relentlessly determined to control you and have you be a certain way, whether they realize it or not, can fuck up your life before you’ve realized it’s happened. Ten minutes with an individual like this can, worst-case, mean hundreds of hours, or longer, to unfuck yourself.</p>
<h4>XII: Spotting a cult leader by overt signs</h4>
<p>Because the subtle signs are harder to detect and sometimes can’t be detected immediately, here is an incomplete list of overt signs that you’re possibly in the presence of a cult leader:</p>
<ul>
<li>[…]</li>
<li>noticing you’re holding your body very still</li>
<li>muscle tension, tension muscles in stomach, shoulders, neck</li>
<li>finding yourself barely breathing</li>
<li>tingling buzzing shimmering anywhere in body</li>
<li>noticing you’re getting sleepy or “stupid”</li>
<li>not being able to articulate something you can easily or could easily articulate in other environments, becoming tongue-tied</li>
<li>feeling fear, anxiety, love, sexual arousal, acceptance, belonging, power, “elitism,” or “having arrived” with no discernable cause or it’s sudden or there’s something intuitively strange-feeling about it</li>
<li>environment where there are “right answers” and “wrong answers,” in actuality, even if lip-service has been given to inclusivity or (provisional) openmindedness</li>
<li>environment arranged for e.g. high-stakes or fast responses, that in order to “get the right answer” you have to not just act but also think and feel a particular way.</li>
<li>narrow interaction patterns—can only interact with them in a certain way because if don’t then they won’t engage or don’t even seem to understand</li>
<li>things that they say are wrong, according to them, are all wrong and completely dismissed, can’t find partial value in things or evaluate things with nuance.</li>
<li>if the good sides of other teachers or teachings are considered, it’s mere lip service and subtle body language or even subtler things is dismissing those teachers or teachings whole-cloth and also dismissing you for even considering their value</li>
<li>body language or tone implying you’re not even wrong, that your question, consideration, position has no value and that you don’t have any value.</li>
<li>they imply other teachings, other goals, other plans, other groups have no value</li>
<li>if “caught out” or forced somehow to interact outside of their normal, narrow window they might become very anxious or very angry</li>
<li>holding up very narrow patterns of behavior (like particular types or styles of interactions) as universally good and that all other interaction styles are bad</li>
<li>in general they’ve created a “closed universe” around themselves where only a very narrow range of things can happen, even if a small number of those things are cool, impressive, or in some way world-facing.</li>
<li>interacting with them will have a “hermetically sealed” quality, where they’ll have an immediate “cached” or “cued up” answer to every possible concern, objection, accusation, etc. You’ll know it’s cached because of the speed of the response as well as the ways it doesn’t quite address the issue raised but seems to talk past it or not consider it freshly.</li>
<li>interacting with them will have a “never quite reaches them” feel, in that, even if your position is restated by them, it will be a “frankencreation” in their own concepts or their own perspective and your actual position will be discarded or dismissed by them. You’ll know this by how their restatement seems to “do harm” to your position makes it less accessible to you.</li>
<li>acting like their “logical” arguments are complete, closed, final, and dominating. playing with definitions of words or philosophical ideas in order to win an argument. becoming extremely abstract or meta—needing to hairsplit premises as a way to win an argument. needing to win all arguments or to dismiss the other position is not even wrong or not worth engaging in.</li>
<li>takes advantage of “good-faith, good-will to resolve disagreements to get to the bottom of things,” takes advantage of “mutual” understanding as a way to get more airtime and sink hooks in, with no intention or even necessarily ability to understand or gain insight from your position, perspective, feelings, etc.</li>
<li>the person has created carefully structured or cultivated groups, organizations, etc. in an attempt to have people behave in a very specific way (because they really need people to interact in a very specific way or they need the world to work in a very specific way, and this is their starting point or safe haven)</li>
<li>in general any hint of rigidity in behavior or what can happen around them or black-and-white-ness or foreclosing or shutting down the behavior of others is at least a yellow flag. If they want a particular type of interaction that can be ok, but if it seems like they can’t handle something else even for a second or they’re white-knuckling or teeth-gritting through part of something until they can get the thing they want, that’s a yellow flag.</li>
<li>particular advocacy for the world being unsafe or bad: doom, apocalypse, collapse, etc. [That’s not to say such things might or might not be true, but claims of their truth are part of a lever to control other’s behavior.]</li>
<li>[…]</li>

<h4>XIII: Teachers and leader timelines</h4>
<p>Timelines are very long. Meditative practice can take thousands of hours to make substantial progress. Real progress is “de-layering,” but many seemingly good practices and produce a combination of layering and de-layering.</p>
<p>Even “fully de-layering” is insufficient because a person must also acquire lots of real-world knowledge about how to be good and safe for other people. And that real-world knowledge has to be “propagated throughout the system.”</p>
<p>Becoming good, safe, and effective is a life-long journey.</p>
<p>If a teacher is doing something weird, it’s usually the case that they have a blindspot or hangup. It’s unlikely that they’re playing n-dimensional chess.</p>
<p>Good teachers can still have buried malevolence and sex stuff that even they aren’t aware of. Unburying and working through all of it will typically take someone thousands and thousands of hours, even if they have a practice that is doing very little initial layering.</p>
<p>But, “asymptotic perfection” is something good teachers and any serious practioner should be aspiring to, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Mistakes, blindspots, and fuckups should be expected, though. And if someone is doing something weird, that you’re vulnerable to, you might want to check back with them every few years instead of sticking with them and experiencing quite a bit of harm, before you realize it, that you ultimately have to undo to make further progress.</p>
<h4>XIV: Layer theory and high-level principles of ethical, nonharmful, noncoercive, safe interaction:</h4>
<p>Generally but not universally, de-layering, or at least not adding layering, is good. Layering is still good as a stopgap, when things are happening too surprisingly, too fast, or in some other unhandleable way, for a particular person.</p>
<p>Remember, layering begets more layering, and, the more layering a person has, the harder it is for that person to make further valued changes to their mind/self/behavior/etc., all things being equal. De-layering creates more optionaity for change, and faster change, all things being equal.</p>
<p>If a person is short-term “forcing themselves into a shape” or “trying to be or act in a particular way,” at the expense of long-term growth, then that is, more or less by definition, layering.</p>
<p>The more a person can “just be themselves” around you, the less likely it is that they will be layering around you or layering in preparation for interacting with you. This is not universally true—a person can, for example, be layering all the time (almost everyone is, in some way), or layering before interaction with anyone, not just you, and so on. So, trying to have it be that a person can let their guard down around you, be unreflective around you, etc., will usually be at least neutral for them, relative to their baseline, and possibly good for them. One could describe this as a “low-stakes” interaction or a “safe” interaction.</p>
<p>There is a failure mode to the above, which is you overtly or explicitly communicating that you are safe or being seemingly safe, but, actually you are being unsafe because of subtle or overt coercive effects.</p>
<p>In subtle ways, you might be wishing (or “needing”) that they would change their behavior, either in interaction with you or in other contexts, and that could subtly bleed through.</p>
<p>You might not even be aware of that wishing or needing, but if it’s safe for them to tell you that they’re experiencing it, then that’s really good. If you are aware of it, then, sometimes, often, it’s better to call it out, to explicitly note the problematic things that you’re doing, to create mutual knowledge. Sometimes, after that mutual knowledge is established, then it’s better to just end that particular interaction.</p>
<p>Talking about “truth” and “goodness,” as such, can sometimes feel like the implication that the person needs to “change now” or “be different now.” Any model or ideal or goal or concept or principle, etc., can be used as a hammer, and might be, even if a person disendorses doing so to themselves.</p>
<p>This can be less likely to happen if the interaction is truly low-stakes.</p>
<p>Interactions can become high-stakes when one person has something rare, hard-to-get, unique, and valuable or even perceived to be critically good or necessary by the other person. Then that other person is especially likely to try to be a particular way to get that value.</p>
<p>A situation can be made more low-stakes for that other person by good-faith and competently trying to either get that person that thing, or to show them how they can get it themselves, or to show them that it’s not actually valuable or real, or to show them that they are mistaken about its rarity or difficult-to-get-ness, and so on.</p>
<p>The more you can obviate yourself in the other person acquiring value, then the more low-stakes the interaction is.</p>
<p>Low-stakes interactions are more likely to be creative, in that both people can work together to do something even better for each other, and everyone, than they could alone.</p>
<p>There are of course issues of low resources (time, money, etc.), coordination costs, entrenched beliefs or preconceptions, excessive ill-will, preconceptions, etc., that it make it hard to have noncoercive, low-stakes, and creative interactions with another person. Sometimes, often, it can require tremendous preparation, over years and years, to arrange self and world to interact with other people noncoercively. But you can do your best, wherever you are on that journey, and it’s worth it.</p>
<p>One final pithy thing, if you’re looking for a quick-and-dirty way to try to know whether you’re being coercive versus, say ethically persuading, is you can ask, whether, functionally, you are <em>influencing</em> a person or <em>informing</em> them. Of course, seeming informing can actually be influencing, and vice versa. But I have found it helpful to check whether I’m influencing (bad, in this usage) or merely information (good, in this usage). If you <em>need</em> a person to respond in a particular way then there’s a real, stringent sense in which you cannot ethically interact with them, at least along that dimension, and more work is required on your part. If you have optionality, power, freedom with respect to X (or they do, or you both do) then the interaction becomes ethical with respect to X. Sometimes this can happen upstream or obliquely. For example, if both people have lots of money or other resources, then there’s less of a surface area, very generally, for either person to “coercively need” each other.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s nice to be needed, or is it? It’s maybe safer to be needed, in the short term. But true safety likely comes from flexible, creative interdependence, trust and reliance and skill versus brittle, inflexible (i.e. layered!) coercion.</p>
<p>Other people’s intelligence, skill, compassion, and love keep us safe, not them being forced into a narrow range of behaviors around you. Of course, people can locally disagree about what’s safe and good, and people can not realize how they’re being harmful, and people can be manufacturing victimhood or engaging in net-destructive self-healing strategies, and so on. So, ideally, as many people as possible are collaboratively and synergistically engaging in effective self-transformative practice and resource acquisition and distribution, etc.</p>
<p>In any case, if someone doesn’t need to layer in your presence, then they can grow in your presence. And, if this is mutual, then you can grow together.</p>
<h4>XV: It’s not cool</h4>
<p>It’s best to consider the powers, the siddhis, the effects as not cool. They can become a thing in communities of practice. And they can become an ugly, escalatory, ruinous thing between practitioners. One or both people can do disendorsed, yet still hate-filled, tremendous harm to the other or to people caught in the crossfire.</p>
<p>(This is a bit of an overgeneralization, but: People uncontrollably (or deliberately) reach for the powers when they have social skill deficits, or they’re very afraid, or deep-down they’re resigned and feel helpless and hopeless. Otherwise, they would have already backchained to something collaborative and instructive, both non-verbally smooth/friendly and explicitly clear, and they likely wouldn’t have found themselves in the triggering situation in the first place.)</p>
<p>If something especially subtly weird is going on, there is minimal to be gained from toughing it out, being seen as strong, by self or others.</p>
<p>And it can be very counterproductive to try to early-on become “invulnerable” to subtle interaction effects. (One is always vulnerable in the sense that we are bathed in it all the time, all things being equal. We can however transcend it, have unconfused, good information processing around it, to let it flow through us as “just information,” “just background,” etc.) Done too early, before enough meditative skill, trying to become “invulnerable” will produce additional layering, increase timelines, and not do much for becoming less vulnerable.</p>
<p>If negative effects are detected, try to separate early and often. Try to reduce incentives for unnecessary interaction (e.g. record talks or publish summaries so not everyone needs to be present).</p>
<p>Try not to hold grudges as this can increase meditation timelines. But, so too, if you are feeling strong negative emotions towards someone, don’t self-gaslight yourself into believing you’re not or that you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>And, you can just leave. You can find meaning elsewhere. You don’t need what they’re selling if it’s a group situation.</p>
<h4>XVI: The quiet interaction and beauty of subtle interpersonal effects</h4>
<p>(You may wish to read “part X: the late-stage meditator in community” before this section if you’re skipping around.)</p>
<p>Over time, interactions between two trained individuals or one highly trained individual and other untrained individuals become relatively gentle and quiet, noncoercive, barely there. Interaction effects gently and liminally enhance intimacy, connection, etc.</p>
<p>(Remember, you’ll always be bathed in the stuff, all the time. But it becomes information instead of influence.)</p>
<p>Brave individuals might use intense interaction effects for training purposes, relating purposes, sexual purposes, etc. All is permitted, as it were. But I imagine most people will have no need or desire for such things, whether they’re leading quiet lives or doing big things, or doing both.</p>
<p>Sometimes, not all of the time, you can just walk away from shit like this.</p>
<p>All that said, sometimes communities become infected, and then one must engage with all this stuff in order to protect the community from the worst of what’s described above (harm to individuals or community dissolution). A community can need boundaries and sometimes “sterilization” or “clean room” approaches. That is, some communities may need skilled shamans*, some of the time.</p>
<p>But if a community hasn’t been “de-layered, de-compensated, cracked open” and there currently aren’t any “dark wizards” in or on the edges of the community, then it’s probably best to leave things well alone. Group practices** that can influence the boundaries between people should be used very sparingly and carefully. They are not games and even sporadic experimentation can have consequences. See the Many Protocol in this document. The Many Protocol should possibly only be explored when there is at least one highly-skilled practioner in the group (thousands of hours of effective practice).</p>

<h4>XVII: Depth of horror</h4>
<p>Horrible things have happened to individuals, often in childhood. Violent abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, extreme coercion. There is religious terror around hells, devils, demons. Terrible things happen to parents and grandparents, too, and that will affect the kids. There is also medical and death horror, we see relatives suffer and die in front of us or we walk in on dead bodies. Even if onself or relatives ultimately survive it can still be very tulmultuous. And there is cultural horror—slavery, extreme racism and bigotry, colonization, imperialism, genocides, holocausts, world wars, ancient curses, ancient gods, etc. All of this is rattling around in people’s minds and between minds, brought forwards through the centuries and decades. The skilled meditator will systematically work through all of this and their own stuff, over time. But there’s a lot and it takes a long time. In the meantime, one is exposed to it, in the water, as it were. And if something gets decompensated, cracked open in a group environment, then it can cause problems for multiple people.</p>
<h4>XVIII: Inappropriate reification</h4>
<p>Remember all the above is just a theory of convenience, a story. Find your own truth. Don’t inappropriately reify any of this or take my word for it. Good science is still true. Planes still fly. Government still do the thing they do. Computers compute. Stuff that’s true is simultaneously true. Give yourself time to integrate new, surprising stuff into a unified worldview. It will take some time.</p>
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>What might (and could) we do together that’s better (more good), for everyone, than what we might do apart?</p>
<p>What might we do together that’s better than what we might do apart?</p>
<p>What might we do together that’s better than what we’ll do apart?</p>
<h3>The creativity of evil</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunate sequences of events produce ignorance, inability, fear, and (perceived or actual) resource contsraints.</li>
<li>Ignorance, inability, fear and (perceived or actual) resource contsraints produce myopic, selfish desperation (that can skillfully hide for a long time from itself and from others).</li>
<li>Myopic, selfish desperation can be extremely generative and can produce tremendous value.</li>
<li>That value production usually comes with spreading, lasting collateral harm (e.g. overt or covert authoritarianism, self-coercion, etc.).</li>
<li>And, that (sometimes tremendous) value produced will have poisonous, toxic components woven deeply into it, usually to the very core, that in some way hurts everything it touches, even as it also can do good things.</li>
<li>Sometimes, evil can self-transcend, de-toxify itself, repair the harm it caused, and provide acceptable restitution and reparation.</li>
<li>Sometime, two or more evils can come together to mutually de-toxify.</li>
<li>Sometimes, one or more people from the outside can extract value from poison, without being destroyed, and can ultimately provide and share wisdom and healing that wouldn’t have been possible before.</li>
<li>Evil is real; it incidentally destroys goodness or directly tries to destroy goodness (and sometimes succeeds).</li>
<li>Evil is illusory; In its place is myopic, selfish desperation that would be (safe and) good, instantly, if it knew how.</li>
<li>It will ok in the end. If it’s not ok, then it’s not the end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Joy</h3>
<p>safety = resolution of problems + mind autonomy</p>
<p>safety + creativity = joy</p>
<h3>Lineages and transformative works</h3>
<p>There’s the Silicon Valley bromide, “A’s hire A’s; B’s hire C’s.” So there’s this awareness of entropy or degradation or something.</p>
<p>There’s a joke about how philosophers or academics in general produce “lesser clones” of themselves.</p>
<p>There’s a big deal, I think, in artificial intelligence around “artificial bootstrapping,” as in, if and how and when is it possible to make something better in some way than its originator.</p>
<p>I think, generally, in the self-help world, an academic or a sharp independent will create a technique, and then people will popularize it. Sometimes the popularization will be recognizable as the original or the original will even be referred to. Sometimes it’s called by the same name, and sometimes this is endorsed by the originator.</p>
<p>And, other times, the popularization will have its provenance obfuscated. The popularizer will call everything by different names, usually water the thing down, make it much easier for people to grasp.</p>
<p>Sometimes this will even be an improvement, but, I think, also, sometimes nuance will be left out that means that people that encounter it won’t be able to use that instantiation to “go all the way” with the material. This can still be a net win if the user would never have known about the existence of the original material or they wouldn’t have had an on-ramp to unlock the original material.</p>
<p>But, sometimes, a couple worse things can happen. First, people can encounter the watered-down version and then think that the original version must be likewise deficient, even though they don’t carefully investigate the encountered original. (They might not know that it’s the <em>original gold standard,</em> or whatever.) Another thing that can happen is that no one will want to invest in the original creator popularizing their work, when they eventually want to get around to it, because “it’s already been done.” I vaguely remember at least one concrete case of this.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is sort of looking at potentially bad outcomes at the level of individuals, consumers and the original creators. There’s system-wide potential negative effects, too:</p>
<p>This happens to some extent in academic science, there’s a proliferation of low-quality papers (this is due to possibly too much funding as well as perverse incentives and metrics). And, skilled researchers can identify quality lines of work and build on those, but less skilled researchers and scientists in adjacent communties have a much harder time weeding through all the crap. This might be isomorphic to the idea of a market for lemons, which is a notable economics paper. If I recall correctly, in a market for lemons (as in lemon cars versus cherry cars?), there’s no way to tell which are the lemons and which are the cherries (back in the day), and so there was no incentive to sell cherries, and the average quality of used car was very low. (I’m probably getting something wrong, here.)</p>
<p>Transferring this over to meditation-land. If there’s too many techniques to try because of low-quality and even well-intentioned popularizers and teachers, and say a person can’t efficiently weed through techniques until they find quality ones, because, for that person, it takes too long to know whether a technique is working or not—they might just not try to engage with meditation techniques at all.</p>
<p>At think wisdom traditions, meditation lineages partially solve this by investing a lot of resources into a small number of people and authorizing some of them to teach and appointing one as a successor.</p>
<p>This helps with succession and quality maintenance but is still vulnerable. It’s hard to be invulnerable to quality degradation. (Sometimes synthesizers or revivalists [or popularizers who choose wisely!] figure out or semi-invent things that are as good or better than the originals, at least along some dimensions.) People from the outside still have to figure out which lineages are actually good, and so there’s still a market for lemons problem, even if the lineage itself is doing an ok job of maintaining quality. And there’s the scaling problem.</p>
<p>Even though science has its issues, it’s partially solved some of these kinds of problems, at scale, with with good feedback loops “truth”, empiricism, explicitness, etc. Again there’s a proliferation of low-quality papers. And, I think we’ve lost a good deal of our ability to train skilled scientists. But something was working ok for a while, and we’re still limping along, and science and technology are still progressing. (I’m ignoring the moral angle as well as opportunity costs, what could have been, in some neighboring world, here.)</p>
<p>One can do a similar thing with self-improvement and meditation techniques. That is, while meditation traditions have texts, there’s often secret knowledge, or keys to unlocking those texts, that could only be gotten in person. (Sometimes people can bootstrap, one way or another, into unlocking texts without forming an intense relationship with a teacher.)</p>
<p>That similar thing is to write better meditation manuals, and to keep improving them. Make them comprehensively explicit and conceptually clear. (My material has a long way to go, but it’s arguably pretty good. It seems like people do best when they’ve had some prior contact with other meditation techniques, and often it takes at least a tiny bit of question-answering with me, but some fraction of people on-ramp pretty quickly. And it’s my hope that skilled people will be able to de novo bootstrap with my material even if they have no contact with anyone who’s used it before, say if they find it on the internet somewhere.</p>
<p>There’s still all sorts of dangers, here. It’s a trope of people destroying themselves with found texts and people mistintpreting texts or teachers, going too far too fast or perversely misterpreting, becoming dark wizards, cult leaders, arch nemeses, and so forth.</p>
<p>But there’s something better, sometimes, about freely available, explicit meditation manuals versus esoteric knowledge mostly locked up in people. (Back in the day, by being esoteric, that’s how some traditions survived, I assume, making it possible for as to know about them and build on them. They kept the knowledge rare and valuable, so they could eat and keep the thing going. Hard problems, here. It sometimes also avoided the dangers in the above paragraph, probably, but the tropes still exist for a reason.)</p>
<p>In any case, I worry that my material will be cleaned up and popularized in a way that both dilutes it and actually harms dissemination, breadth and depth, for some of the reasons above.</p>
<p>More to say, and more to come, I suppose.</p>
<p>It’s partially hard because I want people to take apart the material and rewrite it, because that’s a good way to learn, maybe the best way to learn. And I do want people to improve on the material, to the point that it becomes unrecognizable, in part because it’s better that way or just that it’s equally good (or whatever) but the new language speaks better to a different group of people.</p>
<p>Often when people recreate something, they get it working just enough for themselves, whether they realize that’s what they’ve done or not, and they distribute it anyway, and this contributes to noise in the system, lemon markets, people thinking they’ve already seen better thing but it’s not worth it, and so on. (I think something like this happens in open source software, for some language and some domains. Also the forking, which is sometimes critically excellent and sometimes divisive, resource-draining, and community-killing.)</p>
<p>So I guess I’m asking something like, if you lightly reshape the material, link back to my thing. If you heavily reshape the material, either make it so unrecognizable (if that’s natural) that’s there’s sort of no brand or community overlap, as it were, so that more and more people can be reached without instead just confusing people. And, in any case, try to make it excellent, try to make it so that it takes people all they way from many, many, many different starting points. Make it as excellent, effective, and comprehensive as you can, and powerful enough to take many different people at different starting points absolutely all the way.</p>
<p>It’s my hope that we can make it really obvious who’s stuff is good, somehow cutting through all the noise. And then we link all the good stuff to all the other good stuff, and then people can choose from superb protocols that meet them exactly where they’re at. And somehow there’s just enough choice to benefit people, and low enough proliferation that there’s a very high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>This is a theoretical-technical-empirical problem—makes the instructions interpretable and excellent. And partially a sociological problem—guard the community from entropy and noise. And those two problems are interrelated.</p>
<p>Let’s try to have the right thing happen, and I also hope that my writing this doesn’t have a chilling effect, somehow. Let’s do the best we can to get supremely excellent material safely into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>Maybe it’ll be a long time before people’s work diverges and competes with mine (in a good(!) way or a bad(!) way or both). Or maybe it’s coming up fast. Unclear, at the time of this writing.</p>

<h2>Practice preliminaries</h2>
<h3>Timeline, mindset, trajectory, harm</h3>
<p>I’ve rewritten the below a few times. It still feels like a very early draft, and it could be rewritten one hundred more times.</p>
<h4>Raw hours</h4>
<p>So there’s this partially open-ended thing that you can do with the bodymind. And it takes time, thousands of hours. There’s a part that can’t be compressed, sort of the raw thing you’re working with, the way your mind <em>is,</em> right now, in all its complexity, that has to be worked all the way through. And then there will be contingent things that will make all of that go faster or slower.</p>
<p>If someone is older, they’ll have more raw stuff to work through. [The following sentence is long and hard to parse, and I apologize.] I suspect, for, say, someone who’s, I don’t know, between eighteen and thirty years old, with no really perverse trauma that can confusingly mix good and bad together, for example childhood sexual abuse, who’s really good with working with documents and a teacher, <em>maybe</em> they could start to asymptote around 2000-3000 hours. Maybe. There are still unknowns, here. I suspect something more realistic, for someone between eighteen and forty-five, is anywhere from 4000-10,000 hours.</p>
<p>Every problem you encounter may seem like it’s the deepest last problem. But there will be another, and another, maybe with a delay but inevitably, until there isn’t. So plan for this, in resources (time, money, relationships), possible break-taking (to make money or friends), opportunity costs, etc. One can’t predict using timelines, or plan using timelines—one has to just assume it’s going to take 10 years 20 years even if it only takes 1.7 years. This can potentially be hard and risky, depending on available resources and opportunity costs, and likely or possible sequelae. This paragraph will be at the end of the next section as well.</p>
<h4>Better to finish, and smoothly</h4>
<p>One of the things that’s hard is that, I suspect, for most people, doing the thing will either consume their lives or they’ll get stuck. There’s the saying, “Better not to start. If you start, better to finish.”</p>
<p>Some people will try to fit all this into the way their life currently is, their job, their relationships. That might work, meditating one to three hours per day, with more on the weekends, and intensely a few times per year. (But, again, see above how long that’ll take, calendar time, given the raw number of hours needed to asymptote.) One possible outcome of this is that they won’t notice many things changing. And that’s a safe tolerable outcome. But, if that person gets into some hard stuff, they might not have the “habitual intensity” to get themselves out. And they may get stuck in a state that’s hurting themselves, people they care about, and possibly many people that they incidentally come into contact with in their daily lives.</p>
<p>So there’s a certain safety in “really committing.” You <em>don’t</em> have to do that in the beginning. You <em>can</em> ramp up slowly over six to twenty-four months, maybe, to see if you really want to do this thing. Maybe. We don’t have enough data, yet. This section will change as that data comes in. Be very careful about experimenting, to figure out whether you’re in or you’re out. Don’t accidentally get too far. It happens.</p>
<p>An important part of the that “really committing” is not just knowing that you’re going to put in a lot of hours. That other part is something like “cognitive burden” or “cognitive momentum.” It often or even usually won’t look like normal “figuring things out,” though it very well might, but your mind is going to be occupied solving problems of types its never, ever had to solve before. And, to make progress, this is sometimes going to be going on “in the back of your mind” when you’d potentially rather be, say, making money or enjoying or strengthening relationships. One person described it to be as “whole self demanding” as another full time job or another primary relationship. So, even if one doesn’t meditate for three days or something, that “job-ness” or “relationship-ness” in terms of how the mind is processing beneath the surface (or not) doesn’t go away.</p>
<p>A few paragraphs above, I mentioned, “they may get stuck in a state that’s hurting themselves, people they care about, and possibly many people that they incidentally come into contact with in their daily lives.” Being “really committed” also involves trying to have life flexibility to sometimes dial the intensity up even more, to move through harmful states faster or more smoothly. Other sections will talk a bit more specifically about the possible harms to oneself and other people. But, if something like that is going on, one wants to be able to ideally isolate themselves for as many hours or days is necessary to get to something better. That’s going to put a strain on relationships, depending on how complete that isolation should be. It’s better to have kids after one or both people get on the likely far side of all of that.</p>
<p>This paragraph is in the section above, too: Every problem you encounter may seem like it’s the deepest last problem. But there will be another, and another, maybe with a delay but inevitably, until there isn’t. So plan for this, in resources (time, money, relationships), possible break-taking (to make money or friends), opportunity costs, etc. One can’t predict using timelines, or plan using timelines—one has to just assume it’s going to take 10 years 20 years even if it only takes 1.7 years. This can potentially be hard and risky, depending on available resources and opportunity costs, and likely or possible sequelae.</p>
<h4>A failure mode</h4>
<p>I’ve talked above about “intensity” and “really committing,” but this can lead people into a very common failure mode. So this might be one of the most important subsections you’ll read in this entire document.</p>
<p>When people first start using this material, they might do a thing that could be called any of the things below:</p>
<ul>
<li>magical button-pushing</li>
<li>excessive-faith meditation</li>
<li>superstitious meditation</li>
<li>“meditate-and-pray”</li>
</ul>
<p>What these mean, and they all refer to the same thing, is to sort of be doing one’s best to follow the instructions maybe to the letter, but not trying to understand and enact the instructions to their very essence or core. Even if one is using the meta protocol, and the meta meta protocol, one can still be doing something like this.</p>
<p>It’s better to maybe pretend that the instructions are complete shit, a lossy telephone game, that’s pointing at a real thing (or is it), but something got hopelessly garbled. And, you want the value, but you should then interact with the instructions with the intention to find “the real instructions behind the instructions.” This isn’t a new idea. But, even where some parts of this document are vague, some parts are crystal clear (in some sense), albeit hard to parse or initially interpret. And that (arguable) clarity can make it seem like “all one has to do is follow the instructions,” which just isn’t true.</p>
<p>I tell people they would ideally create their own instruction document, that leaves out none of the essential complexity that this document is pointing to, but is entirely in their own words…</p>
<p>Without this section, I think the written instructions do eventually lead people to the “real instructions,” but hopefully reading this will make that go faster.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize, though, that ALMOST EVERYONE inevitably starts with magical button-pushing. One shouldn’t be ashamed of this. Some percentage of people just won’t be able to help themselves. Not-being-able-to-help-it, to not do it, of course, is why we meditate in the first place. Finding one’s way to the real instructions, over tens or hundreds of hours, is just part of the thing.</p>
<p>Be precise, patient, and gentle.</p>
<h4>Entrenchment and active occlusion (layering)</h4>
<p>Along with “intensity” and “really commiting” and “magical button-pushing,” is sort of “creeping unreflective desperation and unresponsiveness.” Often we start meditating because, whether we can put our finger on it or not, something is terrible, horrific somewhere. There is something really, really, really, really bad. And, the first impulse of the mind, in some sense, once the mind gets just enough knowledge to start making changes to itself, is to reflexively, in some sense, run as far away from the bad thing as it possibly can.</p>
<p>And that running away, paradoxicaly, tragically is exactly the wrong thing that ultimately needs to happen. (That’s often the case but not always. Sometimes the “running away” is the only way the mind can pick up tools to finally turn around and come back.</p>
<p>In any case, whether it’s good or bad, that running away will sometimes freeze not just that deep dark bad thing (or, usually, a bunch of deep, dark bad things) but will “freeze” a whole bunch of other things as well.</p>
<p>That is, a meditator can become more rigid, more neurotic, more belligerent, more unresponsive, more “unspiritual” before things turn around. And some of that rigidity might not go away for until the meditator is close to the “very end.” Or it’ll painfully come and go in ways that are distressing to both the meditator and the people around them, hopes and expectations dashed, over and over again.</p>
<p>So, this section is both for caution and expectation setting but also to possibly make it a bit less likely that something like this will happen. Judicious use of the meta protocol and the meta meta protocol will help.</p>
<p>Another way to look at all this is, at a very different level of abstraction, “don’t even try to make yourself a certain, very specific way. And, even more so, don’t ever try to move forward without understanding why you’re not already that way.” Beware, beware, “I <em>should</em> just be able to do X…”</p>
<p>Again, be precise, patient, and gentle.</p>
<h4>Extreme skill and extreme standards</h4>
<p>It can be helpful to realize that you need to become a genius. You need to become brilliant. You will become brilliant, at least along some narrow dimensions, in the course of doing this thing. If you strive for that, relax into it, things will go more smoothly.</p>
<p>The level of skill and (mostly implicit) intricate knowledge that you need to acquire is shockingly high. It’s like you need to learn every single instrument in an entire orchestra, including the ones that, at least historically, very rarely get used, as well as how to be a conductor. But that’s what the protocol is for. The protocol helps you do that. But if you’re ready for that, you know what’s supposed to happen, then that can go more easily.</p>
<p>Additionally, it can help to reach for words, phrases, and concepts like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>comprehensiveness</li>
<li>systematicity</li>
<li>exhaustiveness</li>
<li>flawlessness</li>
<li>perfection</li>
<li>no shims, no patches, nothing left behind, no subtle errors, no subtle jogs or discontinuities or shear</li>
<li>no stuff hidden under apparent flawlessness or smoothness</li>
<li>no stable bypass, nothing left behind, no shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p>[And eventually you will let go of the above! Perfection-in-imperfection type stuff, aconceptual and post-conceptual type stuff. Letting go of “done” and “done-ness” and “finished” and “end” and “completion,” etc.]</p>
<p>[No-goal, no-plan, no-view, no-position, no-escape, no-refuge, no-end, no-next, no-later, no-elsewhere, no-elsewhen, no-success, no-failure, no-purpose, no-point, no-good[~], no-bad[~], no-evil, no-self, no-choice, no-stability, no-completion, no-path, no-fruit, no-refuge, nothing-to-do, nothing-to-hold-on-to, no-stability, no-foothold, no-bootstrap, nondual, not-two, not-one…][no old life to get back to, no “getting back to it” [afterwards], no elsewhere, no other place, no world out there, no people, no hope, no fear, no remainder, nothing left over, no permanence, no refuge, no foothold, no fixing/stilling, no depending, nothing waiting for you [to finish], no fact of the matter, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide]</p>
<p>That is, it can be helpful to realize, at the finest grain, there’s no vagueness, no “mush,” no “slop.” The mind, in some sense, is shockingly lossless. Like, there’s compression, to be sure, but that compression is shockingly lossless.</p>
<p>You might think of the mind as made up of incompressible, inelastic, lossless, indestructible steel cables that are all very long and tangled together. And you need to untangle them and thread one-hundred percent of them all the way through their individual needle holes. And because of the nature of those cables it’s simply impossible to cheat.</p>
<p>Or, you might think of the mind is made up of one’s and zero’s, like a computer program or something. (And, luckily, there’s tons of parity checking.) And, by the time you’re finished, not even a single bit can be wrong. No bits left behind, not a single one.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be stressed about this, in the sense that the mind is going to lead you to all those needed untwists or bits left behind. In some sense, which is part of the whole point, the mind isn’t going to let you half-ass anything. That’s not how the mind works.</p>
<p>But the main point is that, the more you go with the grain of this, the more smoothly it will go. There’s a right ordering to everything, to be sure. And sometimes it’s going to suck.</p>
<p>But, if you know that you might indeed need sometimes to spend five hundred hours going after one “bit,” and indeed you might need to do that twenty times, that’s just part of the practice. That <em>is</em> the practice.</p>
<p>Again, the protocol will lead you to this level of conscientiousness and skill. The protocol (and the meta protocol and the meta meta protocol) and how the mind responds will lead you to find every last one of those bits, in some sense won’t let you do anything less, will help you be sure you’ve got them all. You’ll eventually get a taste for perfection, flawlessness, etc.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to work at the finest grain. You’ll learn how to act with continuity, continuousness, without inappropriate gaps, jumps, jogs.</p>
<p>The protocol might start out feeling super clunky, not like meditation at all. But, over time, bottom up, it’ll look more and more like “classical contemporary noting” [<em>sic</em>] and concentration without support.</p>
<p>Go with the grain of this, not against it.</p>
<h4>Physical sequelae</h4>
<p>If you start inclining towards the very faintest beginnings of crippling muscle tension, nerve root impingement, intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, then you’ve left something out. There’s a memory or a “bit” missing, somewhere. Engage the meta protocol and meta meta protocol and the preliminary/auxilliary practices and outside resources, if necessary, to go and find it. Ideally, do these things long before there’s even the faintest hint of muscle tension, etc. It’s much, much easier for any of that to creep up on you than it is to dispel it.</p>
<h4>The end of your world (after adyashanti, maybe?)</h4>
<p>Along with that extreme skill and extreme standards, there’s also something needed like courage or bravery.</p>
<p>In some sense, everything you thought you knew about everything is going to be wrong. Things are going to seem pretty normal on the far end, but, holy shit, in the middle, sometimes.</p>
<p>Your deepest assumptions are going to be questioned, and you’re likely going be absolutely shocked, at least a few times.</p>
<p>And some things are going to creepingly seem like horrible, horrible, intolerable “truths” at least at first. Or you’re eventually realize you’re mistaken, or you’ll eventually realize it’s not actually that bad.</p>
<p>But, there’s probably going to be away in which “everything is taken from you,” sometimes figuratively or at least psychologically (or even spiritually; or even literally, if—understandably but tragically—parts of your life get fucked up).</p>
<p>Bravery. Courage.</p>
<h4>Drama</h4>
<p>Beware of decompensated impulsiveness. Don’t cheat on your significant other. Don’t blow up at your friends. Don’t create situations where you need to be saved. Don’t be dramatic. Be exactly as dramatic as you need to be but no more.</p>
<h4>Error propagation, wayfinding, grace of what minds are</h4>
<p>Holy shit, a lot of warnings here, about things that can go wrong. It’s important to keep in mind, and this has been a lifeline for me, and it’s true, the mind is ultimately reversible. Any “mistake” or mistake the mind has made, whether it was in the first moments of consciousness or a dumbass (as it were; or completely innocent) thing you were doing for <em>two thousand hours</em> in the course of meditation. The mind will ultimately untwist its way to that thing, raise that thing, backchain all the necessary prerequisites, complete those, and then correct the thing. And that’s whether you’re eighteen or ninety. All you need to do is practice correctly, to responsively, methodically, intelligently, intuitively crank. Meditation works because this is what minds are. This is what minds do and this is what meditation does and that’s why we’re doing it.</p>
<p>Error propagation, meditating (or just living) in a way that incidentally or systematically spreads and ramifies errors throughout mind, experience, and behavior is just a thing.</p>
<p>But meditation is also systematic error-correction, problem-solving and backtracking.</p>
<p>Meditation is global wayfinding.</p>
<p>Meditation is not, say, “strength training” or a “faith exercise” (although surrender and faith play a part).</p>
<p>Meditation is unlocking an intricate puzzle box.</p>
<p>Meditation is global wayfinding.</p>
<p>Meditation is wayfinding.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The mind is vast but practically, nonmonotonically, asymptotically finite.</p>
<p>Have you been cranking?</p>
<p>cranking = enacting regular and routine progress; doing the thing</p>
<p>idealized cranking = correct use of the different parts of this document at the correct times, responsively, personally as you concretely work with and through your individual mind</p>
<p>Have you been cranking?</p>
<p>You might also see the “gentle on-ramp”/“onramp” section elsewhere in the document as well as the “meditating by coincidence” section.</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p><em>[from: <a href="https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/2000-hours-to-full-classical-enlightenment-plus-risks/">https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/2000-hours-to-full-classical-enlightenment-plus-risks/</a>]</em></p>
<p>The stuff below has a mild and transient version all the way up to an extreme and chronic version. I describe sort of the worst-case scenarios below. In the worst case, you might need to drop everything, or as much as you  possibly can, for weeks, months, or longer to solve it, on your own or finding a teacher or teachers who can help. This could be very costly to finances and relationships. If you experience flickers of any of the below, and you likely will, it happens, a lot, it certainly doesn’t mean you’re on your way to a worst-case scenario, but you should treat flickers calmly but with great seriousness. Don’t make seeming “progress” at the expense of even a slight uptick in the direction of any of the below. Again, you will likely skirt the faint or even moderate edges of all this stuff, so don’t freak out, and/but this is all very, very serious stuff.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the very, very worst, some people will run into extreme 24-7 muscle tension somewhere in their body lasting months if not a couple years. (Some people also have a less terrible version where the muscle tension is only present while actually sitting down to meditate.) That’s fine though super not great at all if it’s in your thigh or something. But, if it’s in your head, then you’ve got significantly increased intracranial pressure or something, depending on how your body downregulates blood pressure or vasodilates or etc. I imagine this could be really risky for someone who is at risk for stroke. Additionally, if it happens in your neck or spine then you could be a risk for nerve root impingement and permanent structural or neuromuscular impairment or other disc injury sequelae. And your sleep could get really fucked up depending on how skillful you managing weird musculoskeletal stuff with pillows. These are real risks. It can mess up exercise, intimacy, finances, daily life, etc. […]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the very worst, due to weird subtle stuff that you’ll begin experience extreme sensitivity to other people. Like, being around people, working shoulder-to-shoulder with people, being on the phone or video chat with people, sleeping next to someone you care about, will become radically intolerable for some number of weeks or months. This is a real risk. This could destroy relationships both intimate and financial. Due to the same weird subtle stuff, people might come to find being around you to become completely intolerable even if you’re fine being around them. And this as well could destroy relationships both intimate and financial. (To me, this means that meditation and pregnancy or even having kids under eighteen probably don’t mix or mix in risky ways.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether weird subtle stuff or not, your mind is figuring out how to change itself, and that’s a lot of power for a still-dumb mind to have. So we’ll call this interim magnification of negative traits. There is a (possibly quite long) period where self-deception as well as harm to others can very easily increase, where the meditator is blind to it and also really hurt by all the accusations and doesn’t respond to them in a super-constructive way. This will likely be you, especially if you think of yourself as a person who is generally really careful about this sort of thing and/or who doesn’t have the propensity or desire to hurt other people. For more, see here: <a href="https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/clickbait-title-you-are-so-bad-real-title-benevolence-subtle-imposition-manipulation-and-control-and-ideology/">https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2019/03/30/clickbait-title-you-are-so-bad-real-title-benevolence-subtle-imposition-manipulation-and-control-and-ideology/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So then, finally, there’s emotional and motivational dysregulation, sometimes extreme, e.g. extreme suffering and can’t do anything, for hours or days or even weeks, or even more. How fucking weird and terrible things can get, in the worse case, cannot be overemphasized. And, it goes without saying that this can be bad for relationships and finances. Interestingly, I currently don’t think “psychosis psychosis” [<em>sic</em>] is much of a risk, even when things are super crazy weird, maybe like little flashes that are rapidly corrected, but there’s probably a non-zero risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, there’s opportunity cost.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Again, this could break you, this could ruin your life, ruin your mind, ruin your relationships, hurt a significant other, hurt your kids in entire-life-affecting subtle and overt ways, etc.</em></p>
<h3>Environment and subtlety; (more) risks and rabbit holes</h3>
<p>[editing note: needs at least some editing to tighten up the point being made and for run-on sentences, at the very, very least. may go for more concrete examples, later, too, along a bunch of dimensions.]</p>
<p>As you dissemble and reassemble your idiosyncratically built up sensory processing system, as it were, choice about where and when you meditate can matter, more some times and less other times, over the long run, sometimes for idiosyncratic reasons and sometimes for more general reasons. Over time, you must come to be able to make good choices about when to modify your environment (time/money/mental/interpersonal cost-permitting) and when to leave it alone (time/money/mental/interpersonal cost-permitting), whether during meditation or just in daily life.</p>
<p>So, environment-wise, systematically or opportunistically, it can be good to try many different things, and to try to discern what makes differences if there are seemingly differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>inside structures</li>
<li>outside of structures, outside</li>
<li>different structures/buildings</li>
<li>different rooms in structures/buildings</li>
<li>different locations in rooms</li>
<li>different times of day: sunrise/dawn, sunset/dusk, noon, middle of the night, early morning hours, early evening</li>
<li>city, suburbia, rural areas, countryside</li>
<li>sea level, high hills, mountains</li>
<li>different humidity, air pressure, temperature</li>
<li>on boats and airplanes</li>
<li>by rivers, lakes, oceans</li>
<li>different soundscapes and vistas or lack thereof</li>
<li>different weather conditions</li>
<li>soundscapes and vistas and lack thereof</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also get a lot of cheap variety if you’re doing walking meditation, indoors or out and about.</p>
<p>The claim is not that you must spend the time, money, and mental energy for exotic meditation experiences, definitely not that. And, surely, over time, you you want to be able to meditate effectively (and live fully) under a sufficiently wide range of conditions.</p>
<p>[Some environments might be good every once in a while to maybe get unstuck, but are not necessary, and can be prohibitively costly to do regularly: anechoic rooms, flotation tanks and other sensory deprivation chambers, etc. I’ve played with a couple of these a few times, but in no way relied on them. It seemed like a good idea to include them for completeness.]</p>
<p>But, all sorts of weird, counterintuitive things can matter over the short and long run, so it’s good to experiment. At least some of the variables are cheap to manipulate, and other variables can be manipulated opportunistically.</p>
<p>You’ll start to notice subtler and subtler things, which will afford data that might sometimes be interpreted “superstitiously.” So, this is also yet another channel to explore and refine your epistemics, self-beliefs, meditation-beliefs, and cost/opportunity-beliefs, and to generate explanations of apparent influences on your practice, which you might find to be real or illusory, over time, and which you might become more and more robust to, over time, if they are real. (You might also transiently become more and more affected by them, which might be why they became more and more salient to you in the first place, whether for “superstitious” reasons, or not, which would not be unusual, and depends on idiosyncratic factors.)</p>
<p>In any case, sometimes it’s a very, very good idea to meditate when weird right-now distracting or unpleasant environmental stuff is going on. And other times, it’s more productive to seek out different conditions for meditation.</p>
<p>This is yet another area where you may go a little crazy before you go saner than you were before. And, trying to arrange one’s environment, because of believed/experienced effects, those effects may or may not actually being long-run problematic, whether one is meditating or living life, can become costly in way that, for people without the time and money, can be a net life negative.</p>
<p>In response to an earlier draft of this section, a collaborator writes:</p>
<p><strong>[A]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>You may discover that obvious and non-obvious stimuli have a distracting [or otherwise right-now-believed-to-be negative] effect[s….] And also, you may discover that some of these are chronically present in your environment, which you were not aware of, and you may become convinced they're bad for you, and please don't fuck up your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[A]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>To expand on the don't fuck up your life part, some well-intentioned gaslighting may be in order. Point out meditator's pain which not really about the position of your leg, point out that even ordinarily you will sometimes find a sound intolerable that you live with otherwise, point out that you are already inhabiting the world including these aspects and removing yourself from that comes with trade-offs (morality is the first teaching etc)</p>
<p>[…]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[A]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the way I think you really do have a tightrope to navigate here because one of the unique things about this system and this community is all the […] baggage it comes with, positive and negative. Assuming that any sort of spiritual practice will make you start acting like a crazy weirdo for a little bit, I find it much preferable that it goes in the direction of buying an air quality monitor or talking about primal sleeping positions and doing things in the spirit of […] weirdo optimizations rather than […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[A]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like I blew $200 on that [air quality monitor] and now I wonder about brain damage when […] lights a scented candle</p>
<p>But otoh it's nice to get a ping to crack a window sometimes instead of being distressed that I'm just not feeling smart or energetic today</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 1:15 PM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>it’s true. both. i think all of it can get integrated and sort of a costless choice to light the candle or not, open the window or not, but possibly crazy in middle and some people won’t have time/money/something to weather the crazy and it won’t be net good for them.</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly</p>
<p>Eat less carbs when it's a cheap option because it is legit better, but still outperform when you're on a pasta-based diet</p>

<p>Yeah. One of my ex’s knew me for a health nut and was shocked when I ate a huge Snicker’s bar in front of her. And I was like, well, a few of these will be like they never happened, and, I didn’t have time to cook, and, I know it won’t make sleepy and also I won’t be hungry for hours, and if I eat it all at once and then eat normal food later then it won’t contribute to insulin resistance. And I know I’m going to get some magnesium and potassium (etc.) later, and they have much lower trans fat than they used to, and peanuts are poison but only if you eat a ton for like a whole week or two, and…</p>
<p>And she was like, oh, [aspirationally] reality-based.</p>

<h3>Posture</h3>
<p><em>[section needs editing]</em></p>
<p>You should be continually cycling through different meditation postures, to vary the kinds of feedback you’re giving your system. This reduces risk, including the risk of muscle tension issues. You might sit and stand in a single day. Or you can sit for three days, stand for two days, be in bed or on the couch for a day, etc. Never trade increased muscle tension for “progress.” It’s not worth it. I personally meditate pretty equally sitting, standing, and lying down (I might do one of these for several days in a row then switch). I do less walking and yoga asanas. Sort of unrelatedly, but I wanted to add it somewhere, I also alternate earplugs versus no earplugs, blanket or no blanket, eyemask or dark room versus bright room or open space, eyes open versus eyes closed, laying on back, laying on my right side, laying on my left side, etc.</p>
<p>Favorite meditation postures/combinations (unordered): sitting, lying down back/sides, Zhan Zhuang / standing, walking, running/jogging, yoga asanas, eyes open/closed, earplugs +/-, eye shades / complete darkness / pitch black +/-, netflix, amazon video, facebook, twitter, watching blog stats</p>
<p>Ah, also like "erect kneeling", knees on something padded, and otherwise "standing" straight. (If I'm doing standing meditation and my feet start to hurt, I switch between standing and this type of kneeling.) Different postures change salience of different feedback loops. Safer.</p>
<p>Oh, more for completeness: leaning with back (butt) against low things like countertops where everything above the lean is unsupported/erect. Leaning back against walls. Finally, sometimes facing wall bracing with hands.</p>
<p>More distinctions: sitting without back support, sitting with back support (still erect), and hella slumped in some comfortable couch or chair in some long-term comfortable way. always mix with erect/unsupported sitting and standing!</p>
<p>more distinctions: sitting on a hard, very flat (parallel to ground, no tilting) surface; sitting on a very firm but nevertheless soft surface (like a big memory foam block)…</p>
<p>Also, E Tai Chi (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tai-Chi-Basic-Book-Simplest-ebook/dp/B01MREOH1P/">https://www.amazon.com/Tai-Chi-Basic-Book-Simplest-ebook/dp/B01MREOH1P/</a>), custom/ad hoc tai chi, and custom/ad hoc yoga asanas</p>
<p>[Also: ad hoc “internal martial arts” rearranging your weight, rearranging your stance, rearranging your relationship with gravity, rearranging your physical anticipations…]</p>
<p>Also, sort of “upright fetal position”, maybe in the corner of a big chair or couch, with one’s back against the armrest and leaning to the side against the back. I am more likely to stay awake in this position if I’m tired but I can still drift in and out of sleep while meditating, and it’s a different kind of balance than laying in bed.</p>
<p>Also, custom/ad hoc device assisted stretches</p>
<p>Also, ad hoc dancing, bouncing, rocking, fidgeting, stretching, yoga pretzels…</p>
<p>Earplugs can enhance sensitivity to subtle muscle movement and body creaking in head and neck and elsewhere but make sure meditate plenty without earplugs, too.</p>
<p>Long-sleeve clothing, pants (vs shorts/skirts) or blankets reduce subtle air current and temperature changes on skin which can make it easier to attend to other things. (So, sometimes this is good to do and sometimes it’s better to be exposed to the elements.)</p>
<p>Long-run, retrospectively, you might have spent equal time sitting, standing, and laying down while meditating. Sometimes it’s good to switch every day or every hour.</p>
<p>On twitches and posture and readjustments—</p>
<ul>
<li>Might want to gently restrain</li>
<li>Might want to gently repeat</li>
<li>Might want to gently hold in the “twitched” position for a while to see what happens</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s the cliche of having something to bite down on, when experiencing pain or something. I’m not suggesting that, though it could be good—teeth generally aren’t supposed to touch teeth, but, if your jaw happens to be clenching, putting in a mouthguard might be good for your teeth and bad for your jaw—maybe ask a dentist or something about tradeoffs. In any case, the point of this paragraph is to make an analogy to biting down on something: if your hand is clenching, it can make it safer for your hand to clench if you clench a stress ball or a rolled up shirt. If your neck is doing weird things, it can be helpful to do that laying it in a cradle of pillows, and so forth. It’s good to be able to meditate sitting or standing tall, but it’s also good to be able to arrange your environment when/if that’s the best thing, too. Another take: “Having things squeeze or slide against can slow things down, reduce currently problematic degrees of freedom and/or increase feedback through resistance or friction”</p>
<p>Another postural thing to vary: Surfaces from very hard concrete to very soft for standing, sitting, and laying down, for very different kinds of feedback. For lying down: both on back and side, with and without a pillow. You might look into “natural sleeping postures. Firmer head or neck pillows can give better feedback for spotting creeping muscle tension or having it not arise in the first place.”</p>
<p>You should check to make you’re not losing flexibility or that certain physical movements (or patterns of attention) aren’t becoming subtly unpleasant or aversive. Also, barbell weight training and bodyweight exercise is good, too, as another way to check for whether something is off, e.g. if some exercises become aversive or you’re losing strength or less able to transmit power through structure.</p>
<p>[book recommendations: feldenkrais awareness through movement, anatomy trains yoga, starting strength, becoming a supple leopard]</p>
<p>Some takes on “perfect meditation posture”:</p>

<li>The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original) by Master Lam Kam-Chuen</li>

</ul>
<p>“Perfect posture” should be explored for the possibility of maximal useful feedback and safety.</p>

<li>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that you can also interleave/weave these questions (or the spirit of these questions) with[/into] a main meditation practice as you're doing it.</li>
<li>Don't force the questions below. If you're mind doesn't want to answer them, then don't make your mind answer them.</li>
<li>You don't need to get complete answers or verbal answers to the questions. Just good-faith try/intend to answer, being willing to release the <em>how</em> of how you're getting the answer or answering. When in doubt, let go and start over or let go completely. Let your mind have time and space to answer the questions however it wants. The mind might answer by doing something rather than answering the question, specifically.</li>
<li>You don't need to ask the questions below verbally or discretely, though it's good to experiment with that first. You can also cast your mind over the questions or the memory of the questions, sequentially, semi-sequentially, or all together, all at once. Try to vary how you're accessing the questions, verbally/sequentially versus all at once, and the degrees in between.</li>
<li>There is a "meta meta protocol" [<em>sic</em>] which is applying this protocol to itself. There are contextually better and worse ways to use this meta protocol and there are better and worse interpretations of how to use it. The "meta meta protocol" can help you move towards better and better interpretations and uses.</li>
<li>Note that the meta protocol can be used for other things besides meditation, such as problem solving, planning, or really anything, mental or physical.</li>
<li>Lots of things have the “flavor” of the meta protocol, without looking exactly like the below. You might feel like you’re “not doing the meta protocol” but you actually are! Any time you’re wondering whether you doing the right thing, or if a good or bad thing happened, or you’re asking other people and dialoguing about it—that’s “going meta.” It doesn’t have to have the exact form of the below and it doesn’t have to be done explicitly.</li>

<h4>Meta meta protocol</h4>
<p>[minimally edited placeholder transcript; 1:1 message reply] I want to do something like not over or under sell the meta protocol, like, one thing that's important is that one should sort of also apply The Meta protocol to itself so sort of a Meta Meta protocol, and I'm sure there's better and worse ways to kind of weave it into the meditation practice itself.</p>
<p>I know that it's as you know, it's sort of written as like a separate thing, but you picked up immediately—I’m doing the same thing where I'm sort of naturally weaving the spirit of it into the main practice itself in terms of—that was not under selling it—but there's also a thing about not overselling it.</p>
<p>I've recently hammered: meta protocol, meta protocol, meta protocol. I think that's right, and I did say, like, “If non-forcily available” because it can be a thing that’s not good for the mind to do at particular times. And I think that'll be like pretty obvious; the mind just sort of won't be able to do it or it'll feel forcy or effortful so one shouldn’t, just like everything else.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be forcy, as with the main practice. One is interpreting the instructions and applying them in contingent idiosyncratic ways at least in some ways. So this is where the Meta Meta thing comes in.</p>
<p>As with the main practice, let go, hold it loosely, experiment; don’t prematurely reify ontological elements or commitments that seem to be implied by the text.</p>
<h3>Solo practice (“main protocol”)</h3>
<h4>Preliminary/auxiliary practices</h4>
<p>These practices won’t take you all the way and can even tie you in knots, but they can get things going and sometimes unstick things. They are presented in no particular order.</p>
<p>Consider creating for yourself and/or submitting your own preliminary/auxiliary practices for inclusion in this document. Submission could be very useful to other people. If you wished that it had been here, instead of you needing to discover it, or you just think it’d be useful to other people, please submit. Preliminary practices are intended to be unsystematized, ad hoc, a little bit vague, brief, and jargon-free. Ideally they are titled with a short, imperative phrase, but that isn’t necessary. Your submissions will be indicated by your initials or pseudonymous initials (please choose/indicate).</p>
<p>Don’t take these too seriously. Don’t reify them. They might or might not point to deep, metaphysical truths. If they happen to, it’s probably not in the way you initially think. You might or might not have to intermittently throw some or all of these away, forget them, in order to make progress.</p>
<p>You don’t have to do all or any these. Eventually you’ll throw almost all of them away, or at least they’ll be essentialized and seamlessly convolved with so much.</p>
<p>Something being in a preliminary/auxiliary practice isn’t committing to any particular ontology. Take these as experiential games, dialogues between words and experience, physical or mental action and result.</p>

<h5>Have experience</h5>
<p>As it is ok to be lost in movement, thought, or reverie. It’s also ok to be lost in sensation as it happens, e.g. in music or visual beauty or conversation or sex or other sensuality, etc. And it’s also ok if you can’t do this or it never (yet) happens.</p>

For example, while walking, pay close attention to what you see alongside sensations coming from the feet. Or while tapping a tabletop, pay attention to what you hear alongside sensations in the hands.</p>
<h5>Iteratively examine motivation (h)</h5>
<p>To what end am I doing what I am currently doing? And why that? And why that? &amp;c. Can be meta-applied as well: in the course of inquiring what one is doing &amp; why, one may inquire as to what one is doing in inquiring as such, and why.</p>
<h5>Refactor agency (h)</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/11/27/patterns-of-refactored-agency/">À la V. Rao</a>. Notice a thought or framing of some occurrence, and split/clump/invert/rotate/refactor the agency/will of whatever is involved.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Those flowers are alluring” → “Those flowers want to be admired”;</li>
<li>“I want to eat the doritos” → “The doritos want to feed me”;</li>
<li>“I hate this traffic” → “This traffic jam is angry with itself”.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Invent a concept (h)</h5>
<p>Name the unnamed. Slice reality along a new axis.</p>
<h5>Mindful hygiene (h)</h5>
<p>Practice hygiene slowly, attentively. Brush your teeth; floss; brush your hair; shave; wash your hands/face; bathe; trim nails; apply ointments/lotions.</p>
<h5>Mindful eating (h)</h5>
<p>Eat slowly, attentively. Do you want another bite? Which bite do you want? How does it feel when you put it in your mouth, as you chew? Temperature, texture, flavor? What happens when you swallow? Can you feel your stomach receiving the food?</p>
<h5>Examine time (h)</h5>
<p>Examine the passage of time (perhaps while attending to a particular sensation, such as an ongoing noise, or perhaps not).</p>
<h5>Do it more slowly (h)</h5>
<p>If it’s okay to do so, slow down in whatever you’re doing. Slow down more. And more. And juuuust a bit more.</p>
<h5>Hug yourself (h)</h5>
<p>Hug yourself. Touch yourself lovingly. Caress, rub, massage, hold. Which parts want attention? Let your body be an instrument of care for itself.</p>
<h5>Want everything (h)</h5>
<p>To whatever degree(s) it’s good &amp; safe to do so, allow yourself to fully and totally desire everything desirable, large &amp; small, good &amp; bad, immediate &amp; far-reaching. Want it all.</p>
<h5>Want nothing (h)</h5>
<p>To whatever degree(s) it’s good &amp; safe to do so, allow yourself to fully and totally release/forgo any and all desires. Accept this &amp; now as sufficient and complete.</p>
<h5>Disclaim (and reclaim) volitionality</h5>
<p>Interact with yourself, or parts of yourself, or what’s in you, only through a respectful interface; disclaim volitionality for what’s behind the interface. Drain your will from it. Temporarily treat it as not you. How can you affect it, now? What’s the right way to interact with it under these conditions?</p>
<p>Also: Do the opposite. Reclaim as makes sense, which might be an equal amount.</p>
<h5>Take a break</h5>
<p>Take a break from everything. Take a complete break. Totally rest, temporarily.</p>
<h5>Listen</h5>
<p>Listen for something faint and distant.</p>
<h5>Imagine/hallucinate</h5>
<p>Try to hallucinate life-sized, three-dimensional people, appearing/existing around you in your present physical space, as a problem-solving tool, a general exploratory tool, for fun, for sexual fantasy.</p>
<h5>Desire factoring</h5>
<p>Imaginatively remove (and maybe put back) things from something you desire until you figure out the essence of what you desire in the thing.</p>
<h5>Explore dimensions of phenomenology</h5>
<p>In what you’re experiencing right now, explore meaning-laden phenomenology; explore meaningful phenomenology; explore valenced/unvalenced phenomenology (pleasant/unpleasant); explore the absolute, mediate, and immediate causes and conditions of phenomenology, explore the and immediate and mediate effects of phenomenology.</p>
<h5>Pain of lack</h5>
<p>Feel the pain of lacking, the pain of not having.</p>
<h5>Wanting versus liking</h5>
<p>Explore the relationship between what you want (to do/have/experience) and what you, at least historically, <em>know</em> you <em>like</em> to experience. Explore the relationship between what you want to avoid and what you know you don’t like to experience.</p>
<h5>Resource testing</h5>
<p>Imagine yourself with various extra resources, only one or two at a time (money, very nice clothing, healthy solid relationship)—what changes? How would things be different?</p>
<h5>Only this moment</h5>
<p>Temporarily pretend only this moment exists.</p>
<h5>Exactly what it needs</h5>
<p>Imaginatively/bodily/experientially give something exactly what it needs, exactly the relationship it needs, with the person/entity it needs (friend, parent), in the language and concepts it needs, with the emotions it needs, that that something can feel, experience, and understand.</p>
<h5>As a friend</h5>
<p>Ask, what advice would you give a friend about this?</p>
<h5>Querying ability</h5>
<p>Ask, could you do that? How would you do that? How would you solve that?</p>
<h5>Its job, its goal</h5>
<p>Ask something in you, that might not be you, what its job is, its goal, its purpose. Ask what it needs. Ask what’s good about it being there? Explore its felt goodness and badness.</p>
<h5>Bad counterfactual actuality</h5>
<p>Ask, would it be bad if this/that/X weren’t true? Ask, would it be bad if this/that/X were true?</p>
<h5>State/find the X</h5>
<p>State the inner conflict, state the contradiction, state the physical impossibility (such as “those two things can’t coexist in the same space or be done with these resources or go faster than the speed of light or teleport). Or just find it; you don’t have to state it.</p>
<h5>Seek implicit understanding</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>
<h5>Seek explicit understanding</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>
<h5>Find the sparkle</h5>
<p>Find the childhood and/or teenage parts of you that sparkle with wonder and joy and appreciate and enjoy them and embody them</p>
<h5>Intention</h5>
<p>What are you intending, planning, willing, right now? What is your intention [with respect to X]?</p>
<h5>Counterfactual closure</h5>
<p>Ask, what you could have done differently, along with some minimal other changes to a situation, so that X bad thing wouldn’t have happened? Or that would have made the bad thing ok?</p>
<h5>Stretch (h)</h5>
<p>Like a cat that just woke up from a long nap. Try while standing, lying down, or in some other position. Shoulders back, chest out, get on your tippy-toes &amp; arch that spine, yawn, vocalize, release!</p>
<h5>Connect deeply with purpose/value/meaning/goodness (h)</h5>
<p>Notice your current situation/trajectory, and connect as deeply as you can with how this situation/trajectory is (now &amp; ongoingly) meaningful &amp; valuable, what purpose it serves, what broader good(ness) it relates to, etc. In what ways is today good/meaningful/valuable? How does the goodness/meaningfulness/value of today connect to the goodness/meaningfulness/value of your entire life?</p>
<h5>Notice the past (h)</h5>
<p>Notice momentary or ongoing conceptions of the past.</p>
<h5>Notice the future (h)</h5>
<p>Notice momentary or ongoing conceptions of the future.</p>
<h5>Notice discomfort (h)</h5>
<p>Are you (greatly or subtly) uncomfortable right now? Which sensations tell you that you are uncomfortable? Why doesn’t everything about right now feel great/fine/perfect?</p>
<h5>Attention pulled</h5>
<p>Let your attention be drawn places and maybe actively stay there for a bit once you get there.</p>
<h5>Volitional attention</h5>
<p>Attend somewhere two-dimensional or three-dimension or n-dimensional or non-dimensional, specifically, for at least a brief time.</p>
<h5>Liminal/nonverbal (inspired by h)</h5>
<p>Do what you’re already doing but deliberately move towards going it liminally verbally or nonverbally.</p>
<h5>Curiosity for disagreement</h5>
<p>Have respectful curiosity and inquisitiveness for what happens to be in you or is a part of you, that you disagree with.</p>
<h5>Resist attentional capture (1)</h5>
<p>Some of the time, temporarily, concentrate (on something). Facilitate attentional capture.</p>
<h5>Resist attention capture (2)</h5>
<p>Some of the time, temporarily, have a wide, open, fuzzy focus. Concentrate on everything or no-thing. Relax, do this minimally, minimally reactively, as minimally involved as you can.</p>
<h5>Balance foreground and background (cf Lippmann and Culadasa)</h5>
<p>Become aware of everything you can become aware of, in the “background,” while also attending to a “foreground” object. The background is in your peripheral awareness (cf. peripheral vision). Look both at and “through” the foreground object. Balance the salience of foreground and background so that they are potentially seamless in brief moments or stably.</p>
<h5>Look past (interpretive) overlays</h5>
<p>Look at something; look past that at “what’s really going on.”</p>
<h5>The really truly possibly really good in the bad</h5>
<p>With the expectation that there’s something good and important, there, a wisdom of some kind: Ask would it be good to keep doing this bad thing? How would it be good to keep doing this good thing? Would it be bad to stop doing this bad thing? How/why would it be bad to stop doing this (at least partially) bad thing?</p>
<h5>The chakras</h5>
<p>Attend for some time to each chakra, bottom to top, including genitals. Hara. Hands. Feet.</p>
<h5>Microcosmic orbit</h5>
<p>Move attention slowly through microcosmic orbit (loop around front and back of body from crown of head to perineum and back) in the direction [down the front, up the back; up the front, down the back] that feels most smooth.</p>
<h5>Bad to know/understand/see/be-able-to-tell</h5>
<p>Ask, is it bad to know [about] X, bad to understand [something about] X, bad to be able to see [something about X], bad to be able to tell something about X? If so, how did that come to be? Why? How do you know? How did you come to know?</p>
<h5>Homomorphic ostension or reference</h5>
<p>Come up with a metaphor, simile, allusion, allegory, analogy, or story for a relevant thing that might be otherwise hard to put into words. In that, what’s the problem, in that language/structure/ontology? What could be added inside that language/structure/ontology/logic? What’s obviously missing when seen from inside that?  How would manipulate that to solve the thing, strictly inside or that language/structure/ontology?</p>
<h5>Being/from</h5>
<p>Ask, is this from me? Is this from you? Is this me? Is this you? Is this him/her/per/them?</p>
<h5>Somatic refactoring</h5>
<p>Feel and relax your way into beneficial “somatic refactoring.” Let the body naturally and intricately change.</p>
<h5>Explore the body</h5>
<p>Exhaustively, but loosely, sensitively, being willing to back off or let go, explore the entire value of the body  with your attention, little by little. If you can’t attend somewhere, don’t force attention into the area. Explore what feels good and bad about this and what seems good and bad about doing it in different places and a different times.</p>
<h5>Fix/solve/solve</h5>
<p>Ask, can you do X/that? Can you fix X/that? Can you solve X/that? Can you handle X/that?</p>
<h5>Provenance and historical explanation</h5>
<p>Ask, how did that/X come to be?</p>
<h5>Looking/checking with what you already have</h5>
<p>Ask can you look to see whether that’s true or not? Can you find that out with what you already have? (If not, can you get more information if you need it? How? Can you do that? Will you do that?)</p>
<h5>Personal evaluative comparison</h5>
<p>Ask, for me, why do I want/choose/like/desire/pick/etc this/X versus that/Y. Which is better or worse? More good or less good versus each or the other?</p>
<h5>Meaning</h5>
<p>Ask what does it/X/that mean?</p>
<h5>Ghost/energy hands</h5>
<p>Touch your body or feel into your body with ghost/energy hands.</p>
<h5>Fractured reality</h5>
<p>Feel the fractures of reality. Feel how reality is broken.</p>
<h5>Look down through the body</h5>
<p>Look down through your neck into your body from the inside</p>
<h5>Look at the back of you head (after Headless Way?)</h5>
<p>Look at the back of your head from the outside without the aid of a mirror, phone, anything.</p>
<h5>Be (pop?) zen</h5>
<p>No goal, nowhere to go, nothing to do, no escape, start or where you are, gateless gate, stateless state.</p>
<h5>Stop trying to escape the now</h5>
<p>Temporarily stop trying to escape from exactly what’s happening, exactly how it’s happening, and exactly what it is that’s happening.</p>
<h5>Take a break</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>
<h5>Collect simultaneous attentional objects</h5>
<p>“Collect” things in your awareness to pay attention to, and attend them sequentially or simultaneously.</p>
<h5>Ghost/energy body</h5>
<p>Be physically relatively still, but walk and move with your “ghost” body or “energy body.”</p>
<h5>Acceptance</h5>
<p>Accept that this is your life now or in fact always was.</p>
<h5>Instantaneous immortality</h5>
<p>Noticed that in this moment you literally cannot just directly and successfully choose to die.</p>
<h5>Expand</h5>
<p>Expand into the available space, “outer” or “inner.” Accept/become the available space, “outer” or “inner.”</p>
<h5>Broken phenomenology</h5>
<p>Feel your “‘broken’ phenomenology”; rest in it, all of yourself with it, as it is.</p>
<h5>Inability/can’t/ability/can</h5>
<p>If you find you can’t do something, explore how to phrase it conditionally:</p>
<p>(You might ask, why can’t I do this? How can I come to be able to do this? How did I come to not be able to do this? How do I know I can’t do this?)</p>
<ul>
<li>can’t X while Y</li>
<li>can’t X when Y</li>
<li>can’t X until Y</li>
<li>can’t X since Y</li>
<li>can’t X where Y</li>
<li>can’t X because Y</li>
<li>can’t X without Y</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, if it might be good to able to do X even while the conditions obtains, you might ask something like:</p>
<p>How might I be able to do X even while Y? What are some worlds where I might be able to do X even while Y?  even when Y? even if it’s not Y yet? even if Y has since obtained? even if Y holds? even if Y? even without Y?</p>
<p>Or, if it might be good to not have the condition obtain so you can do X, you might ask something like:</p>
<p>If Y prevents: How might I not have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y doesn’t obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?</p>
<p>If Y enables: How might I have Y obtain? Are there good worlds where Y does obtain? What might such a world look like? How might I know I were in such a world? Might I be in such a world already or how might I arrive in such a world?</p>

<h5>Shackles</h5>
<p>Ask, is X “shackles on” or “shackles off? [via Martha Beck's Finding Your Own North Star and Steering by Starlight]</p>
<h5>Exertion (ae)</h5>
<p>Exert yourself past a few layers of muscular and cardiovascular exhaustion, but not so many that you have to stop, to achieve a difficult goal.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> This one needs refinement of scope and clarity, and also careful consideration of safety in the most literal ways. For me comes from climbing, hiking, alpinism: "Exert yourself past a few layers of muscular and cardiovascular exhaustion, but not so many that you have to stop, to achieve a difficult goal." I'm pointing at something that feels qualitatively different to me than HIIT-type pushing to failure. It seems important that there is a summit or whatever to get to (and come back from!) and what you are doing is ultimately unsustainable but will last you just the next hour/day/relevant medium term, and somehow you are doing a bunch of inference to figure out just how hard that means pushing yourself right now.</p>

<h5>Explore gratitude (h*)</h5>
<p>Ask, what are you grateful for, right now? How do you know you’re grateful? What does it feel like? What don’t you feel grateful for? What is it like not to feel grateful?

<h5>Explore courage (h*)</h5>

<h5>Catch flinching (h)</h5>
<p>Notice when you flinch, turn away, shut down, distract yourself, change the subject, compulsively open reddit in a new tab, etc. Don’t try to do anything about the flinching, yet.</p>
<p><em>Comment: (a*)</em></p>

<p><em>Comment:</em> For me &amp; probably others, there is residue from the way I was taught to meditate, namely from instructions like “if you notice you’re thinking, return to the breath” or similar. There are some very tight hooks in my mind such that when I notice certain things, I immediately have some internal reaction. There are lots of them, but one which is probably pretty common for people who’ve tried pop meditation is: notice thought -&gt; interrupt it &amp; pay attention to something else.</p>

<h5>No space</h5>
<p>Provisionally try on the idea that there is no space, no spatial relations, no adjacency, no empty space, no things occupying space, no delimited volume, that these don’t exist and that they never did. but, everything else is exactly the same. What now?</p>
<h5>Embrace identity</h5>
<p>Explore if/that/whether you are one, in particular that you are this one. and not that one or any of these or those other ones.</p>
<h5>Already dead</h5>
<p>Consider the idea that you’re already dead but everything else is exactly the same. What now?</p>
<h5>Right before you start</h5>

<h5>Trust your perceptions</h5>
<p>Trust what you observe, plain as day. Rest in what is obvious and veridical to you right now.</p>
<h5>Honor mediate wrongness</h5>

<h5>Call bullshit</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>
<h5>Remember relevant assertions</h5>
<p>Remember all the ways people/books/websites/etc have asserted or implied what people are, what minds are, how minds should be used, what’s good and what’s bad, what’s true and what’s false, how truth works and how it must be found, how minds work and how thinking works, how thinking should be done, what’s good to do, what’s bad to do. Do you agree, disagree, or are you uncertain? What must you believe or disbelieve? What do you endorse or disendorse about this?</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> This stuff gets in, it gets reified, some portion of it’s good, some portion of it makes us rigid, blocks our truth-seeking, our creativity, our joy, our seeking.</p>
<h5>Notice judging/blaming (h)</h5>
<p>Thus, and develop a method to inquire/analyze/understand/orient around it (or not).</p>
<h5>Notice pressure (h)</h5>

<h5>Notice support (h)</h5>
<p>Notice the ways that everyone is subtly or overtly supporting/encouraging/loving each other all the time.</p>
<h5>Have patience</h5>
<p>Have perfect, sensitive, intricate, painstaking, long-game patience. Pocketwatch watch-building and watch-repairing, where the gears are normal tiny size but the watch is as big as a moon, and different tiny parts on different sides of the moon might need to precisely co-vary, so you might need to go back and forth between them. Sprinkling colored sand, not geoengineering or even shoveling dirt.</p>
<h5>Not too much/too large</h5>
<p>Remember the mind is big but you can practically get through it “all,” in a first pass, in a fraction of a lifetime.</p>

<h5>Don’t overthink things (j)</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>
<h5>Unsurprising-surprising dissolve</h5>
<p>Explore that so many things you might never ever have to solve because they’ll truly turn out to either not be a problem or that they never were actually a problem.</p>
<h5>Comfort yourself (h*)</h5>
<p>Thus, or: offer compassion to yourself] thus, as genuinely as you can [but no more genuinely than that]</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> i have gotten a lot of mileage out of saying “it’s okay [...], you’re doing a great job” to myself, either spoken or written. but it seems to be important to actually express it in one way or another; i.e. simply thinking the thought doesn’t do nearly as much as writing or speaking to self does.</p>
<h5>Separate (don’t) want/might (to) be true (h)</h5>
<p>Separate things that you really really do/don’t want to be true from what is/might actually be true.</p>

<h5>Spotting (aj*)</h5>
<p>Pay attention to how your level of activation changes as you move your eyes to different positions in xyz space.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> Moving my eyes seems to cue different attention patterns to my body and near-body space.  Something like linear search across x then y, then z seems to zero in on activating coordinates well.  Fascinating. [See maybe: Kenny Dennis; Brainspotting]]</p>
<h5>Basis</h5>
<p>Ask, what is the basis of this? What does this depend on?</p>
<h5>Privilege effortlessness, costlessness, and intuition</h5>
<p>Thus.</p>

<h5>Let yourself be supported (j)</h5>
<p>Feel the ground underneath you. Notice how little you have to do to be held, and how much support the earth can provide. Relax/ease into this support.</p>
<h5>Abandon reason (j)</h5>
<p>Act/say/do/want/request/believe/assert/head-in-the-direction-of... just because you feel like it, even if you don’t have reasons, even if it doesn’t make sense, even if you don’t understand.</p>
<p>Don’t feel a need to justify or provide reason (to yourself or others). That which doesn’t make sense. That which you don’t understand.</p>

<h5>Play (h)</h5>
<p>In whatever domain you happen to be in, see if you can play. Notice if you can’t.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> “Explore childlike playfulness” already exists in the prot. The two feel different to me.</p>
<h5>Keep going (j)</h5>
<p>So, you just discovered/encountered/realized the truest truth [sic], or the most perfect plan? Before you rush off and buy those plane tickets, consider holding your discovery lightly, and keep going, keep turning the (relevant) crank(s).</p>

<p>Tired, sad, hungry, anxious, etc. — ask how do you know [you are] (that) [right now]? How do you know, of things like that, what you are right now?</p>
<h5>Commit (for the purpose of potentially dissolving)</h5>
<p>Really commit to the taboo, illegal, immoral, frivolous, dangerous thing you want to do, to do/be/have/get/experience the thing. Start to plan, start to pre-enjoy. Start to figure out how to make it happen.</p>
<h5>Love, compassion, sympathetic joy</h5>
<p>Reach for your felt experience of these, with or without object.</p>
<h5>Error perspective</h5>
<p>Remember, it’s ok to find that you’ve “been doing it wrong.” That means it’s working. That means you’ve been doing it right. And you are doing it right. Perhaps feel into this.</p>
<h5>Find your can’ts</h5>
<p>Find your “can’t beliefs”: can’t do X, can’t learn Y, could never Z, could never in a million years do Q… These can be both “inability beliefs,” where you straightforwardly can’t do the thing (or so you belief, or right now but maybe not later) or “won’t beliefs,” like, you could but you won’t because of something else--too risky, too emotionally intense, too emotionally risky, etc. For all of this, it can get more subtle--can’t do X with my mind, can’t learn to program, can’t learn to factor these numbers. So, things from your past, too, say, maybe early in school or before school. It can all the way to “deep sensory processing” type things--“my mind won’t/can’t do that” or “no minds can do that.”</p>

Deem them as horrible and bad as they are, to you or in the absolute. Explore how to make it safe to not suppress this, to not talk yourself out of this, to not try to (prematurely or otherwise) forgive them, to not try to (prematurely or otherwise) understand them or walk in their shoes so as to humanize, empathize, etc. (You can surely do all those things, but also explore the former things, too.</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> People do things completely outside our expectations, sometimes outside our expectations of anyone, anywhere doing such a thing or being such a way. A natural response is potentially the emotions above. They might be more extreme or last longer and more repetatively than you thought possible or good. But allowing those emotions, when there’s enough wisdom/slack/space in the system, when it’s safe to allow those emotions, facilitates processing, model building, wisdom. On the other side of those emotions is wisdom--sometimes it’s forgiveness, sometimes it’s forbearance, sometimes it’s surgical competence, sometimes it’s love, and many other things. Can’t predict the specific shape of wisdom (I think; though it can be healthy/smart/good to try).</p>

<h5>Posture differential (h)</h5>
<p>Incline toward "perfect posture". Incline toward your body's natural posture. What changes?</p>
<p><em>Comment:</em> Not perfectly formulated, and for some reason I'm not totally thrilled with the concept behind this one. Maybe at least needs comment about how problems can be on either side — one's posture can be imperfect due to eg muscle tension; or one's idea of "perfect posture" can itself be imperfect.
Maybe I'm not thrilled because reifying the idea of "perfect posture" could be harmful</p>

<h4>Main practice(s)</h4>
<p>[Unlike the preliminary/auxiliary practices, which are open-ended, the main practices are designed to be a seamless unity, a seamless closed set. At a later time, I will work out how to explicate some of the principles behind their design. In any case, by exploring them, and engaging the meta protocol with respect to them, you must come to implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, understand their interrelationship and appropriate usage, for yourself, on your terms, in your own concepts and words. You must find the “real” practice(s), the correct thing(s), behind the words below.]</p>

<li>your motivations or reasons, beliefs, knowings, understandings, or expectations for or underlying the actions, doings; things you’re doing right now, volitionally or nonvolitionally, as broadly conceived as possible, as exhaustively or usefully as possible</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Get down (think or write down) as little or as much material as comes easily, even just a single relevant word or phrase. (And you can also patiently compose and/or revise as you go, or set up an outline structure to fill in, or do lots of messy freewriting, or a combination…)</li>
<li>Choose, from the material you produced,
    <div class="lower_alpha"></div><ol>
<li>a word,</li>
<li>a phrase,</li>
<li>a sentence, or</li>
<li>a boundary (e.g. between two sentences; this can be stylized as the last word and punctation of a sentence and the first word of a subsequent sentence) from the material you produced.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lift it out, while remembering its context, and you might put an equals sign to the right of it.</li>
<li>Now, on the righthand side of the equals sign, say the same thing using more words than on the left side of the equals sign. It’s ok if you produce something partial, imperfect, or nothing.</li>
<li>Now, you might return to the original material for more content to repeat the exercise, or take something from the zoom/expansion/analysis you just did and zoom/expand/analyze  further.</li>
<li>Feel free to refactor, revise, expand, reboot the original material as much or as little as you’d like.</li>
<li>For anything you produce, be willing to throw it all away, plan to throw it away, be willing to forget for something better in the future. Don’t push, don’t force, don’t strain. Let the whole thing go. Let the whole thing move and flow.</li>
<li>You can also, and this is recommended, create new wholes.
    <div class="lower_alpha"></div><ol>
<li>For example, if X = M + R + T,  and, Y = Q + G + V, then take, say, R and G. And, do this: “Z = ? = R + G.” Now, what is “Z”, what is that “?” between Z and R+ G? In other words, instead of putting things on the left hand side of the equal sign and then putting more things on the right hand side of the equals sign—instead, first put things on the right hand side of the equals sign and then put fewer things on the left hand side of the equals sign. Find new wholes and larger contexts. You might find wholes contained in larger wholes contained in larger wholes…</li>
<li><p>You might play with this template:</p>
<blockquote>[this/these] whole(s) Y is/are/contain(s)/= [this/these] parts M[, F…] + “just exactly/precisely [this/these aforementioned]/and nothing else”</blockquote>
<p>That is, M and F are known; you have some words for them. Now, what is Y? What are some words for Y?</p></li>
<li><p>Another kind of inverse is adding a subscript to the word on the left hand side of the equals sign and then looking for definitions for the other subscript. For example, you might have “suffering =“ and maybe before you even try to fill in the right hand side, you might do:</p>
<p>suffering_1 =<br />
suffering_2 =<br />
suffering_3 =<br />
and so on.</p>
<p>You might ask, what is everything I could possibly mean by this word (or phrase) “suffering”/X?</p>
<p>In this way, the word “suffering” can become more detached and flexible from the underlying language, while at the same time making each use of the word more precise. The subscripts do not have to be numbers; they can be anything that helps to differentiate which meaning/usage/sense of the word that you mean. That might be times or durations or conditions and so forth. [See also General Semantics for more on the idea of “indexing.”]</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Also, consider intensional multischematism. For example, you might say that the same M can be referred to by single word R and single word H. That is R and H have different meanings/intensions but they refer or point to the same thing or set of things. Further, R = G + H + T and X = V + W + Q.  That is, (G + H + T) and (V + W + Y) each have different meanings, but correspond to R and X, respectively. Further, you might notice that, say, T and W, while using different words and meaning different things, in fact refer to the same thing(s), have the same extension. Another way of saying things like this is that the concept M, or that which directly represents M, or &lt;M&gt;, refers or applies to M using the word “M”. Or, you might say that both &lt;M&gt; and &lt;K&gt; refer or apply to the same extension; “M” and “K” refer to M and K which are actually the same. In our syntax and semantics, here, M = K.</p>
<p>Example a: This M and this K are the same (thing). [not just the same type of thing. &lt;this M&gt; and &lt;this K&gt; corefer to M (which is K) and K (which is M).]</p>
<p>Example b: All Gs are also Hs.</p>
<p>[note that the above is ambiguous as to whether X, Y, Z, etc. are “bound” or “unbound” for any given X in the language/wrting above]</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1a:</strong>
    X = The cat sat on the mat.</li>
<li><strong>Example 1b:</strong>
    Y = cat in X = furry animal + …</li>
<li><strong>Example 1c:</strong>
    Z = furry in Y = experientially noncontiguous nonhomogenous light nonpunctate/distributed pressure when touched gently</li>
<li><strong>Example 1d:</strong>
    Q = noncontiguous in Z = mediacy and absence = missing immediate relations = a proper subset of immediate relations from a particular designated/delimited closed/finite set</li>
<li><strong>Example 2a:</strong>
    T = rippling water = directionality backflows dappled light dark traveling shimmers twinkle flecks arc chase over under undulate</li>
<li><strong>Example 3a:</strong>
    R = The last thing was cheese. We find that in these cases…</li>
<li><strong>Example 3b:</strong>
    M = [cheese.] [We] in R = …summary signpost implication…</li>
<li><strong>Example 4:</strong>
    B = ? = cat + dog; B = ?; B = a partial set of quadrupedal mammals, those things that [for my purposes…]…</li>
</ul>
<p>Places likely worth investigating:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where something seemingly X somehow leads to (or somehow depends on) something seemingly Y, or vice versa. (e.g. when doing something bad is good or when doing something good is bad);</li>
<li>Where something is seemingly somehow X and Y at the same time;</li>
<li>Where something is seemingly somehow X and Y at different times;</li>
<li>Where something is seemingly somehow either X or Y conditionally;</li>
</ol>
<p>where X, Y =</p>
<div class="lower_alpha"></div>

<li>that is something that has some attribute or property, that doesn’t have that same attribute or property</li>
</ol>
<p>Further notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might also write/think/say things (assertions) and then incline towards generating relevant (apparent, seeming, believed, thought, felt, wondered, imagined, suspected, endorsed, something…) counterexamples or contradictions to those things. And then use the things and the counterexamples or contradictions to improve on the original thing or to write a better thing not subject to the original counterexamples or contradictions.</li>
<li>Some additional good concepts, semi-separately, are “error correction”, “counterfactual”, “counterexample”, ….</li>
<li>Try also: not X = [pick things and see if they’re in or out, let this change anything]</li>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>good; cf. ok, good, better, best</li>
<li>bad; cf. bad, worse, worst</li>
<li>The order in which you do things matters. Some things will be bad to do now but good to do later and vice versa.</li>
<li>A “doing” or “willing” can be any of atomic/punctate, a discrete/bounded interval/duration, or a semi-indefinite/ongoing modulated continuity/continuousness [“modulated continuous/unbroken application”].</li>
<li>Sometimes, rather than stopping (or not doing) a bad thing and starting a good thing, it can be good to make changes to improve the bad thing, to make it better.</li>
<li>Sometimes a composite “doing” or “willing” will be bad or good, e.g. a willing that has one or more part 1’s and one or more part 2’s all happening simultaneously (in different “places” or “locations”). [e.g. “controlled or channelized falling backwards”, “surrender or have faith in the midst of stuck-forwards-ness”]</li>
<li>Sometimes a complex combination of willing and not willing and acting and not acting all together at the same time will be good or bad. (e.g. “deliberately don’t do X [e.g. everything that hasn’t worked or has stopped working or has had mixed results] or actively refrain from doing X plus have faith”)</li>
<li>Summary outline: good/can presence of will do; bad/can presence of will don’t; can’t then stop; good/can absence of will do; bad/can absence of will don’t; can’t then stop; good/can presence of action do; bad/can presence of action don’t; can’t then stop; good/can absence/undo action do; bad/can absence/undo action don’t; can’t then stop.</li>
<li>Active willing and doing can be a continuous, experimental molding of propositions and actions or will and acting as such, rather than stopping and starting bad and good willing and doing. Stopping and starting good and bad willing and doing, and so forth, as specified above, is good, too.</li>
<li>Will and doing can be as simple or complex as is good and can have qualifiers or “guards,” e.g. “will that P via(/by way of first Q[, then E then H), and including that no bad second-order effects happen, including but not limited to these T, V, F…” and that complexity (and simplicity) can be explicit/verbal, liminally verbal, “hidden” in the “implicit” part of an explicit proposition, as it were (making no ontological commitments about minds the existence of propositions), or fully nonverbal/implicit/felt/etc. One can specify the “how,” more or less concretely or abstractly, or one can leave out the how, depending on what happens to be good.</li>
<li>Willing and doing can contain problematic metaphysical, ontological, or mechanistic/causal errors, explicitly or implicitly, in presuppositions, premises, implications, or other ramifications. Willing and doing can be part of strategic errors, of course—timing and ordering errors as well as other suboptimalities.</li>
<li>An example P = [I will that] I am able to make sure that I’m safe for self and others in a way that is costless and unreflective and becoming this way itself didn’t cause undue or irreparable harm to self and others… [do your best to have a maximally wide conception of what a valid P could be, aspects both verbalizable and very difficult or impossible to fully verbalize]</li>
<li>An example A = carefully make sure that I’m aware that I can be aware of the skin over my bicep while attending to my posture as a whole while making sure that… [do your best to have a maximally wide conception of what a valid A could be, aspects both verbalizable and very difficult or impossible to fully verbalize]</li>
<li>“do so” can mean both start doing so and keep doing so (allow, participate, etc.); “don’t do so” can mean both stop doing so and deliberately refrain from doing so (allow, participate, etc.)</li>
<li>“good/bad to (not) do/will X” can possibly be read as “good/bad to (not) do/will X contextually for me in this case”; there are other readings.</li>
<li>One might will a conditionally; e.g. I will that X (only) if Y; e.g. I will that (it the case that) X (only) if (it is the case that) Y.</li>

<li>Sometimes willing and doing will have good parts and bad parts. And if you decompose them you can leave out the bad and do just the good.</li>
<li>If some willing or doing is or would be good to do except for some bad thing about it, then, if you can, take apart the willing or doing so only the good part remains and do that. Or, find a way to compensate for the bad thing, that you can do and is good to do, and also do that.</li>
<li>p2 ~= willing/absence, surrender/absence, doing/absence, undoing/absence</li>
<li>ex: will that I know what’s good to will through a sequence of self-states that are not too bad</li>
<li>ex: will that I know what’s good to do through a sequence of self-states that are not too bad</li>
<li>(1) If good to will and can will (or keep willing) do so. If bad to will and can stop or prevent, do so. If good to do one of those but can’t, then make sure you’ve stopped trying completely. (2) If good to surrender and can surrender (or keep surrendering) do so. If bad to surrender and can stop or prevent, do so. If good to do one of those but can’t, then make sure you’ve stopped trying completely. (3) If good to do and can do (or keep doing) do so. If bad to do and can stop or prevent, do so. If good to do one of those but can’t, then make sure you’ve stopped trying completely. (4) If good to undo and can undo, do so. If bad to undo and can stop or prevent, do so. If good to do one of those but can’t, then make sure you’ve stopped trying completely.</li>
<li>Sometimes a doing or willing will be both good and bad, that is one or more (sub-)parts of the willing  will be good and one or more other (sub-)parts will be bad. This can be fractal as (sub-)parts can have (sub-)parts that can be good and bad. One can use doing and willing (if good and possible) to break apart willings and doings into (contextually) good and bad parts or “neutral” parts that can potentially be done by themselves or recombined into larger units and done as a whole. [How to do the actual “breaking apart” is hard to specify generally; it will be contextual, contingent, and idiosyncratic. See p8 for evocative possibilities. Briefly, you might ask what’s good or bad in or about things. Again, please note that none of this is intended to presuppose or make ontological (or even/including methodological) commitments about how to do this or the nature or essence of such parts. Remember to not  inappropriately reify anything, including notes like this.]</li>
<li>There is a “special” class of doing, the doing that precedes/enables/causes/facilitates not doing or the absence of doing. X might = suppress, dispel, dissolve, prevent, block, have the absence of, do-to-not-do, do-in-order-to-not-do, hold-back, allow-something-else-to-happen, etc. [Remember to not inappropriately reify any of this.][cf. pleasant distraction or pull-away is not always good to follow or surrender to. See distraction/diversion/displacement in p3.]</li>
<li>Don’t improperly reify “proposition,” don’t take that too seriously. “Propositions” might have an “implicit component” not fully accounted for by the words.</li>
<li>All the above applies to willing/doing you’re already willing/doing—if become aware you’re willing/doing it, you can keep doing it or stop/have the absence of it, as per the rest of the instructions.</li>
<li>good [to do] = contextually good [to do], now, at the very least</li>
<li>compare “good” with “good (enough)”—when same; when different?</li>
<li>Example: ”have been good to do so" ~= Like, you try to (a) do/will X or (b) have the absence of Q, because it seemed like that would have been good. But you find you can't. And then you explore whether there's still a part of you, something, somewhere, that's still trying to have (a) or (b) happen.</li>
<li>Your generally available set of actions/doing should expand over time, more fine-grain, more differentiated, lighter, omni-directional, multifarious, start-on-dime, stop-on-dime, interleave rapidly. They should also ideally become applicable in more and more contexts, more body locations, more phenomenologies, more senses/meanings/etc. Sometimes your available actions will shrink to a point, and that’s ok. But generally you want more and more, and more and more subtle, sometimes fast, barely nameable, barely effable, beyond language, and so forth. You might sometimes have mental tags or phenomenological tags or verbal tags or “knowing contexts” for them, and that’s great. And, there will be times when you’re taking relatively more new and/or unique/one-off/instance-of-themselves/unclassifiable actions/doings. (In some sense they’re all unique by virtue of their preconceptual referent and context.)</li>
<li>There can be doing on the border between surrender and doing or vice versa, where are you sort of doing but you also surrendered, or vice versa. Liminal doing; liminal surrender.</li>

<h5>p9</h5>
<p>Explore what your “normal ideal day” would be like, do this imaginatively, generatively, “concretely immersively.” That is, as best you can, experience it as if you’re actually there, in the first person, in real time, in full sensory and perspectival detail, including inner experience.</p>
<p>So, this includes, but is not limited to, your thoughts, feelings, everything, successes, failures, ease, challenges, rote tasks, fun tasks, texts or artifacts you’ll write/create or consult as you’re doing so, the reactions you get, how people respond…, how you feel, who will be there…, includes experiences of planning, expecting, anticipating…, remembering, thinking (content of those thoughts), beliefs, willing, doing…, how you feel in your body from first person, how you think about your body, what you want the whole world around you to be like, how the whole world works, your past accomplishments, you expectations of future success, your imminent experience of the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>This is not a concentration exercise. It’s ok to do it partially and imperfectly. Planning and reverie and (seeming) off-topic-ness are ok.</p>
<p>See if you can minimally effortfully do this, with as much allowing as possible. If anything gets stuck or jammed, let go and try something different. No forcing.</p>
<p>Let go as you do this. Allow what you thought you wanted to change endlessly (if it does). Also, try not to impose on what you want. What you want right now is what you want to the degree that it’s safe to want it. What you want can change to the degree that it’s safe to want it right now.</p>
<p>Again, experiential/sensory/qualitative, first-person concreteness is what’s key to this practice. Concreteness.</p>
<p>Additionally, with respect to “ideal,” above, also consider “intrinsic motivation,” what is “intrinsically motivating.” (The use of this phrase is intended to capture a certain pre-reflective ease, excitement, interest, and drive and is not intended to be a theoretical or ontological commitment.)</p>
<p>Also, holism is key to this practice, at least as something to keep in mind. The experience you’re exploring is a slice of an entire life, a slice of an entire universe, moments in an entire consciousness. Holism. Unity. Wholeness. Unifiedness. Seamlessness. Simultaneity. All together, all at once.</p>
<p>If you find that the concreteness is “too much detail” in that you “don’t care” about certain details and would prefer thinking more abstractly, see if you can fill in that “don’t care” (non-)detail with something concrete, and then see if you can fill in that detail with something intrinsically motivating. You don’t have to keep it. You can let it go afterwards. “You have to fill your days with something.”</p>
<p>You might find you can’t do parts of this or can’t do any of it at all. You might be blocked or cut off or cut out. This might be because you have the experience of being not allowed, or too selfish, or what you want is too childish, impossible, immoral, evil, pathetic, hurtful, dangerous, too hard, to risky, imaginary, a fantasy.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, just do the best you can. You might try, for each objection, to see if you can correct or handle that objection. If you cannot, just let it go for now; choose another practice and come back later, as with all the practices. Here you can also mix in practice [p2], the willing/doing practice.</p>
<p>Finally, all the above is the canonical, main practice. And/but, you can also try similar things with “the rest of the day,” e.g. when you wake up you can concretely explore your ideal rest of the day. You can do something similar for “tomorrow” and finally “goals” and “milestones” if those sorts of things are in your felt ontology.</p>
<h5>p10 [experimental]</h5>
<p>This practice might be called “minimal unit partially ordered imaginative/generative concrete planning.” That is, in some sense, it is a planning practice.</p>
<p>Explore what you want and what you might do by imagining/generating immersive, concrete experience, as if you’re fully living it, in two subsequent moments. And repeat.</p>
<p>first person concrete experiential qualities in —&gt; first person concrete experiential qualities out</p>
<h3>Interpersonal practice</h3>
<h4>Formulation 1 (including Many Protocol)</h4>
<p><em>(strategy flavored; mutual epistemics flavored)</em></p>
<p>A move M could be in the context of conversational or other local, real time interaction. Or a move M could be composite and part of a long-term plan. So, a move could be right here and now (or soon), taking place, once initiated, in a single moment or across a small number of contiguous moments, or a move can be planned for future, as part of a global strategy, or anywhere in between. And the number of people considered can be from n=2 to n=billions.</p>
<p>Less obvious moves, in addition to particularly other-directed moves: “non”-moves, receptive moves, waiting patiently moves, self-care moves, time out and stopping temporarily or for a longer duration moves, being-helped moves (e.g. free-associating, saying what’s most bad, saying don’t feel safe disclosing X, saying prefer not to do X without explanation or apology), listening quietly, going with the flow of what the other person is doing…</p>
<p>And, to be sure, we’re “moving”/“move-ing”/making-moves continuously and contiguously. We can’t turn it off. Any “non move” is a move.</p>
<p>It can be helpful, when doing the many protocol with new people, to start with just five minutes at a time, maybe trying five minutes just once in a single day, then five minutes again or ten minutes the next day, and so on. If it’s not working, don’t force it! Just do solo meditation or some other group activity.</p>
<p>It can also be helpful to start very far apart! Everyone ten to thirty feet away from each other! And then move in slowly over minutes or even days.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consider at least n=2 people: A (you) and B (someone else)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a provisional move M that you can take. (Some possibly counterintuitive valid moves M could be e.g. “waiting attentively” or “hopefully being genuinely attentive and responsive while simultaneously planning a move.”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify M as one of the below:
    <div class='lower_alpha'></div></p>
<ol>
<li>bad for A and bad for B</li>
<li>bad for A and good for B</li>
<li>good for A and bad for B</li>
<li>good for A and good for B</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the selected classification in (2), of (a)-(d), classify this classification further as one of the below:
    <div class='lower_alpha'></div></p>
<ol>
<li>believed false by A and believed false by B and actually false</li>
<li>believed false by A and believed false by B and actually true</li>
<li>believed false by A and believed true by B and actually false</li>
<li>believed false by A and believed true by B and actually true</li>
<li>believed true by A and believed false by B and actually false</li>
<li>believed true by A and believed false by B and actually true</li>
<li>believed true by A and believed true by B and actually false</li>
<li>believed true by A and believed true by B and actually true</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out the move M or return to (1). Of course, you can return to (1) at any time as your real time interaction unfolds or other conditions change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Alternative presentation</h5>
<ul>
<li>Consider two or more people, A and B or A and B, C, D, E…</li>
<li>Consider a potentially taken move M, under consideration.</li>
<li>Consider that the status of M if taken is exactly one of the following:</li>
<li>Believed good for A by A and believed good for B [, C, D, E…] by B and actually good for A and actually good for B.</li>
<li>[…]</li>
<li>Believed bad for A by A and believed bad for B by B and actually bad for A and actually bad for B.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Alternative presentation 2</h5>
<p>[yay = good; bleh = bad] “Many Protocol” (Last updated: 2019-09-06; 09:19 CDT)</p>
<p>[See some interesting definitions in Appendix 2]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let there be A and B, which comprise a group G. A is a single person. B could be a single person or multiple people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Person A considers a move M. M can be (a) physically verbal, physical nonverbal, mental, or even (b) a “non-move that’s still a move.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of (a): a verbal observation, verbal question, a verbal request, a quizzical look, a shrug, eye contact...</li>
<li>Examples of (b): thinking about what to say, waiting patiently, waiting patiently with an open mind, leaving the vicinity temporarily…</li>
</ul>
<p>Moves can be complex, that is, moves can be made of submoves that are simultaneous and/or sequential in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, say, something can be “yay” or “bleh” for someone. And, something can be <em>believed</em> to be yay or bleh for someone, <em>by</em> someone. And, two or more people, at a particular time, might disagree as to whether a particular something is yay or bleh (for someone or in general). Also, say, for our purposes, that there’s a fact of the matter or a ground truth, that that particular something is actually/truly (contextually, for a particular person at a particular time) yay or bleh, with no other possibilities. And let those possibilities be possibilities for M. That is, we can have a big list (exactly 64 items) of things that could be the case for M, where only one entry/line in the list is true at a particular time. That list is in Appendix 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, so, person A selects and makes the best move M they can make, in consideration of as many moves as they have time to consider, and in consideration of the 64 possible classifications of moves (in Appendix 1).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, now, the move has been made, and results have obtained. And, now, everyone in G implicitly or explicitly chooses a new A and B(s). Now, go to (1) or (6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If things are moving smoothly and slowly, then, at any particular time, with perhaps some periodic indeterminateness, there is only one A and everyone else is a B. If things are moving smoothly and more quickly, then everyone is simultaneously, at the same time, at all times, both an A and B. Now, go to (1).</p>

<h2>Lists and more</h2>
<p>A few of these sections are sort of “less clear” in some ways than the main practices. Those are sort of “noncanonical” in some sense. I’m not sure how to slice and dice all this yet</p>
<h3>Nonmonotonicity</h3>
<p>So, I suspect the way it goes is, there will be something both so bad and so difficult to change that a person tries everything and then becomes a systematic meditator.</p>
<p>And then a person it meditating and all sorts of things start to get better, but, highly disconcertingly, the deepest worst stuff that can barely look at or can’t look at it all seemingly starts to get worse.</p>
<p>And then finally, finally, finally, finally, finally hundreds but likely a thousand or two thousand hours in, or more, that very worst thing uncoils. (With sometimes intermediate mini-uncoilings.)</p>
<p>I think the combination of intermediate very hard things getting better (when nothing else was really touching them) combined with short- and long-range nonmonotonicities. “So much getting better! So much getting worse?!” makes all this very confusing even if you sort of know what’s going on.</p>

<h3>Bodymindenvironment</h3>
<p>Sensation and representation and belief and expectation, how are all these related? It can be hard at first to experience things like “sensational imprint as such” or “representation as such” or both at once or are they two sides of the same coin? The analogies below are wrong but possibly evocative…</p>
<ul>
<li>body : mind</li>
<li>sensations : meaning</li>
<li>outside : inside</li>
<li>experience : belief</li>
<li>referent : representation</li>
<li>sensing : knowing</li>
<li>experience : belief</li>
<li>appearance : representation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can’t-look-yet (“avoidance”)</h3>
<p>There will be thousands of things that are hard to “look at.” For any particular thing that you can’t look at, you won’t be able to look at it until you can. Your mind figures eventually figures out how to make it safe to look, and then you find yourself looking or you remember to look and you find that this time you can figure out how to do so.</p>
<p>Usually the way your mind figures out how to make it safe to look will be necessarily roundabout and indirect, in a way that you couldn’t have planned or directed in advance. So it goes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it can sometimes be helpful to make a list of the classes of things that are hard to look at, as a way to help your mind more quickly get it’s bearings. Below is a messy sample list of the kinds of things one might classify in one’s mind as “avoidy” or “attention-redirecty.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-grade anxiety</li>
<li>Horror</li>
<li>Terror</li>
<li>Metaphysical horror</li>
<li>Horribleness</li>
<li>Terribleness</li>
<li>Pointlessness</li>
<li>Meaninglessness</li>
<li>Cold-water-Spray-bottle-kitten-shock-outrage-sick(-horror(-terror))</li>
<li>(This-)can’t-be-happening-ness</li>
<li>Hurt-by-others’-actions-ness</li>
<li>hurt-by-others’-unhelpfulness</li>
<li>Drama</li>
<li>Melodrama</li>
<li>Psychodrama</li>
<li>Anything suppressed by the will that feels bad being unsuppressed</li>
<li>Really-was-upset(-about-that)-ness</li>
<li>Really/actually-was-really-bad(-at-the-time-it-was-happening)-ness</li>
<li>Really-did-push-that-away-without-solving-it</li>
<li>Really-did/do-want(ed)-that-ness</li>
<li>Just-can’t-ness</li>
<li>Just-can’t-go-on-ness</li>
<li>Plaintive-desperation-ness</li>
<li>Can’t believe that happened</li>
<li>Can’t believe this is happening</li>

<li>Haste/imminence_pressure/rushing/corner-cutting/force-it-through-ing cf (judged_)too_slow(_ness)</li>
<li>Wrongness/doing-the-wring-thing-ness/this-isn’t-working-ness/(judged_)too_slow(_ness)</li>
<li>?????doubt-in-method-ness</li>
<li>Frantic-ness</li>
<li>Desperation</li>
<li>...sacredness</li>
<li>...unforgiveableness</li>
<li>...unthinkableness</li>
<li>should(-be)-X</li>
<li>needs/has-to-be-X</li>
<li>defending, resisting</li>
<li>teeth-gritting, white-knuckling [will+redirection?...]</li>
<li>blind/unresponsive-just-keep-going-ness [vs a better version...]</li>
<li>Relief(!)—I.e. anything can get tagged as “redirectively bad”</li>
<li>“perpetuators”/“slack grabbers”/“compulsive push-downs”</li>
<li>Etc</li>
<li>cf. the attention redirecting or aversive phenomenologies</li>
<li>has to be uncrusty exposure vs copy or (re)duplication~ facilitation via correct application of do nothing</li>
<li>[some repeats below here]</li>
<li>Low-grade anxiety, panic, horribleness, fear, terror, terribleness, hopelessness, meaninglessness, surprise sudden soul-tap uninterpretable mortal physical peril terror even childhood nightmare/fantasy possibly extreme soul-gripping [perfect fear/intolerable/disgust experiential</li>
</ul>
<p>Again this is a hard thing to do willfully, and one shouldn’t do it forcefully, but it can be helpful to keep in mind “(self-)cornering”, as in “nothing left to do but look” and “surfing up the terribleness gradients”, using experiential badness as a way to prioritize and navigate. Sometimes badness will come up that seems tangiential or in reaction to what you’re doing, but, in fact, it’s directly related, and in some sense should be prioritized.</p>
<h3>Systematicity</h3>
<p>If only one could make a list of what needs to be attended to, and then one could just go through the list. Unfortunately, people’s ontology and ordering for what’s good to do when will be idiosyncratic and complex and evolving and ultimately (often) very fine-grain</p>
<p>But, it does matter what you do when, and that’s part of wayfinding. But, when you just don’t know what to do, you can be systematically experimental. This helps at least somewhat to keep from systematically leaving something out.</p>
<ul>
<li>inner senses (inner/imagined audition, visual phenomena, talking/thinking</li>
<li>in between senses (phosphene splotches behind eyes, harmless tinnitus-like tones)</li>
<li>outer senses</li>
<li>valence/feel</li>
<li>chakra-esque: crown/scalp, brow/face, throat/jaw, back-base of skull, back of neck, heart, solar plexus, naval, dan tien, genitals, sacrum, coccyx, perineum (for the mediate ones, both front and back of the body)</li>
<li>meaning, nonsymbolic and liminally verbal knowing</li>
<li>slightly-out-of-phase-with-normal-attention-“inner space” that is both seemingly “in there” and in-there-“out there” or “out there”-in-there…</li>
<li>non-euclidean body-related space and “inner” space</li>
<li>other “non-sensory” or “non-traditionally-sensory” phenomenology</li>
<li>“body” or “mind” that’s somehow “outside” the skin or “somewhere else”</li>
<li>skeletal muscles (every last one of them)</li>
<li>interoception (visceral organs, sinuses of the skull, pressure, heartbeat, peristalisis, autonomic arousal, etc.)</li>
<li>dermatomes (tiny random patches of skin/sensation all over, matter)</li>
<li>somatically-overlaid-energy-full-body-movement-anticipation-planning-space, “energy work” space, phantom/ghost/energy hands space, “inner stance” space</li>
<li>different frequencies/periodicities (Hz/milliseconds/half-seconds/seconds) of sensation at different depths of the body from skin to bones and inside the bones all over [buzz, tick, waggle, flickering, strobe, vibrate, tickle, wiggle, undulate, writhe, bounce]</li>
<li>extremes: crown, perineum, hands, fingers, fingertips, sides of the fingers, wrists, ankles, palms, toes, soles of the feet</li>
<li>edges: backs/fronts/sides of the arms, backs/fronts/sides of the legs</li>
<li>creases: jaw/neck…</li>
<li>boundaries: back-base of the skull…</li>
<li>vestibular sense: phantom/immersive/vertigo-like moving, translation, spinning, going upside down, rotating</li>
<li>ki, qi, chi, ruach, prana, energy…</li>
<li>the “voluntariness of breathing” (versus the “involuntariness”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you might experimentally want to increase the rate and depth of breathing, if breathing has become too subtle to offer certain kinds of systemic feedback.</p>
<p>also: the subtle movements of your eyes, the subtle movements of muscles in the back of your head and neck, subtle movements of the tongue and jaw, glottis, lips, palate.</p>
<p>states can be important too: sexually aroused, not sexually aroused, desirous of sex, not desirous of sex, possibly various states of emotional arousal</p>
<p>Finally, here are some ways that people systematically leave things out; as best you can make sure to not be systematically avoiding anything, of course with fast moving mind (belief/expectation/thought/imagination/feared possible truths and outcomes, etc.) and sensation stuff, but also old injuries, unsettling or unpleasant sensations around permanent pins or staples from old surgeries, scars (injury or cosmetic), genital circumcision, feared body stuff (cancer? precancer? did i fuck up nerve/ligament/tendon permanently? etc), phantom or feared teeth and jaw stuff, unpleasant “wrong, nervy” stuff. or maybe you don’t like your hands or feet or stomach or thighs or something. don’t avoid.</p>

<p>don’t skip anything, don’t bypass anything, don’t force anything. don’t double-down, you’re probably missing something somewhere else. if you accidentally force, reverse it as soon as you possibly can. rare, weird, unusual, surprising, or uncommon stuff matters. it could be a clue to a systematic avoidance or a bottleneck. eventually you have to touch everything in every way, think “everything,” believe “everything,” do “everything”, remember everything, often from multiple angles, over and over again, in the right global order, though with plenty of room for backtracking and mistakes. every good thing, every bad thing, every trauma, every childhood terror. it’s finite. don’t do so any session indiscrimately; and catching small details can save dozens or hundreds of hours, tiny (or large) unexpected body locations or depths from particular angles or along particular paths, far removed from each other in partially repeating, complex orders; the right turn or surrender to memory or thought or reverie—spending hours painstakingly untangling (local or distributed) X is worth it and necessary, interleaving doing that with large excursions to elsewhere in body and mind may help you find what’s “secretly” blocking that untanglng. sleeping, watching tv, conversing, throwing yourself into experience may offer clues to what to do next. it’s finite.</p>

<h3>(Mental action) and the attentional manifold</h3>
<p>When you’re “doing things” in meditation, with what are you doing it? Your muscles? Your mind? Your phantom/ghost hands? Subtle or gross eye activity? Your jaw? The muscles in the back of your neck? The muscles in the back-base of the skull? Are the big motions or small motions? Sweeping or perfectly still attention? Vague or pin-point precision? Two dimensional, three dimensional, or conforming to a surface?</p>
<h3>The use of the will</h3>
<p>one can of course will changes in life situation and that can be really good</p>
<p>the will stuff explicitly in the practice is (obviously? not obvious at all?) intended to largely be in relation to the practice. some of it will be life goal stuff and intention stuff and planning stuff because of how all that is “imminent” in the mind.</p>
<p>indeed, specifically things like “have this resolve without the use of force in a way that I retrospectively endorse” &lt;-- and keep error checking and tweaking the thing behind the words (and refining the words)</p>
<p>“have this muscle tension go away in a way that doesn’t fuck up something somewhere else”</p>
<p>and there’s a very feely/modulatory quality to it, error checking the willing as feedback starts to come in, ways the willing isn’t achieving or heading towards the right thing, so somehow the “how” or the “endpoint” of the willing has something wrong with it</p>
<p>I’ll usually explicitly will something for brief periods, tweaking it as a I go, and then drop it when I eventually understand how it’s problematic or it’s done enough work that doing something else practice-related is higher-value.</p>
<p>I’ll also examine what I’m already implicitly willing, what I’m already implicitly trying to have happen, because it might be problematic. I might be pushing against something that’s not ready to move, or I might be trying to achieve something problematic out in the world, in the what, how, when, or order. there might be something better to mediately will that gets the same thing or better distally.</p>

<h3>Using your time</h3>
<p>This is a very, very, very, very rough breakdown of how you might use your time while practicing. It could be more granular, and all the percentages could be tweaked more. Note that each “level” adds up to 100%. For example, it’s ballpark suggested that p2 might be 80% of 72% of your total practice time. Or, stated more imprecisely, if you’re doing the protocol proper, explore doing lots of p2. These percentages may change as we learn more. For example, the ballpark suggestion for doing the meta protocol might go down or up. Also, in the beginning you might spend much more time on the preliminary/auxiliary practices, and so forth. These are intended to be the very-long-run breakdowns.</p>
<pre>
protocol 100%
    preliminary/auxiliary practices 4%
    other-person-inclusive practices 2%
    meta protocol 17%
    meta meta protocol 5%
    protocol 72%
        p0 1%
        p1 2%
        p2 80%
        p3 2%
        p4 2%
        p5 3%
        p6 2%
        p7 2%
        p8 2%
        p9 2%
        p10 2%
</pre>

<p>Important: It’s normal to “orbit” this document and the practices, to read this and put it down for a while, or to do the practices and then do other life things for a while. There are many paths up the mountain and many often necessary “detours,” which aren’t detours at all, of course.</p>
<h3>A note on force (plus a brief mention of “redo-to-undo”)</h3>
<p>[minimally edited placeholder transcript] I want to call this a brief note on Force. I've made it pretty clear in different places to not be forcy. And I don't think I'll define forcy, here. But, there's something about getting something to happen, something about threading a needle in a way that feels potentially bad. There's potentially a sense of effort. It can be extreme, subtle, or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>There's a thing that the mind does, which is, in order to sort of do something for the last time or in order to sort of undo something, the mind kind of like replays it or re-does it, that one last time.</p>
<p>So if a person is shying away from force completely, but there's already force in the system, then there's a way in which it will be harder for that remaining force to get undone.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's important to surrender to or to go into that what is generally “not supposed to do,” (in this case, force) so I don't want to say like globally don't be forcy. But sometimes subtly or not so-subtly ease into forcing, or already existing forcing, or allow latent or hidden forcing to appear.</p>
<p>And this “going into,” or “allowing,” or “surfacing,” is for the purposes of sort of self-liberating that remaining forcing or dissolving it or undoing it or undoing its leading edge.</p>
<p>So this is nuancing on top of the general but not universal principle of avoiding forciness or forcing. (And this “redo-to-undo” principle/heuristic also more generally applies. See p2 for more pith pointers to this.)</p>
<h3>Meditating by coincidence</h3>
<p>have you ever heard of so-called “coding by coincidence” i think from dykstra? he’s kind of a dinosaur and it’s not the right thing to write careful proofs for one’s code before coding 99% of the time. but there’s a nice thing in there, something like:</p>
<p>maybe hope</p>
<p>yes experiment</p>
<p>but don’t guess? kind of?</p>
<p>sort of going for exact knowledge of what does what. or to know that if one does X, given this context, within 7-31 hours Y will happen, inevitably. sort of.</p>
<h3>Failure and other seemingly permanent and bad things</h3>
<p>Sometimes parts of the mind believe they will fail, even when, say, the rest of the mind believes in, say, trying and hope and best-effort. Sometimes the way to help that part of the mind is to “fully go into it,” to (temporarily) fully and completely believe that part, be that part, in such a way that you really believe that you will fail, or that you have failed, even forever. This sometimes does not feel good (understatement) and can be scary, especially the first time, and possibly every time (in the likely case that multiple parts of the mind believe that it will fail). But, in that “fully going into it” that part of the mind ultimately relaxes, updates, realizes all the goodness around it and comes to believe that it in fact will not fail. Sometimes you have to fully become something (bad) to become something else (good) even if it temporarily takes you over. Remember that you don’t have to go into something until and if it’s good and safe to do so and only when you in fact can do so. So don’t necessarily, say, try to up front find all the places and ways that you will fail and then, say, try to fully believe that you will fail in that way. Engage p2, the meta protocol, etc. Right time, right place, right manner, etc. (All of the same goes for failure, failing completely, giving up hope, failing forever, forgetting completely, and other seemingly scary, bad, or permanent things.)</p>
<h3>How bad does it have to get?</h3>

<p>[Question/comment wondering if it might be possible to never have to “go into badness,” that, in principle and possibly even in practice, whether there’s always a better option, and then there would be value of reminding people of that over and over again in the world where it’s true.]</p>

<p>I think it will be exquisitely personal/idiosyncratic/contextual, depending on the fine-grain details of that person’s mind. Generally, there does seem to be an at least micro-redo-to-undo, mitigated or made safe by equanimity and various other preparatory things. Agreed that wording and preconceptions will have significant influence on “how bad things are,” though.</p>
<p>I do somewhat less qualifying in the document, or a different pattern of qualifying, because a lot of stuff sort of “comes out in the wash” with hundreds or thousands of hours of meditation. And the meta protocol is also intended to help people correctly orient around interpretation of the instructions. I certainly am not fully accurately calibrated and if I had more resources I would likely qualify more. There is a lot of gentleness in the prelim/aux practices that is elided in the more terse main practices.</p>

<p>There is also, I suppose, “the law of equal and opposite advice”--some people will shy away too much from discomfort. And of course some people will flagellate themselves. I think, long-run, it’s very good to be able to “go into badness”--this becomes ever more safe and constructive/productive over time, generally, I think. cf. “equanimity”</p>

<p>I will note that there’s an important question here of how “soft/safe/gentle” [not to conflate gentle and safe but they are correlated] meditation can be in the limit. If we understood this better, and I hope to, plan to, intend to, in collaboration with others, it will make meditation accessible to a much wider range of people, in a much wider range of life circumstances. If someone could trust that nothing particuarly terrible could happen or that it would happen predictably, then it would be more likely they could do work/career/money and relationship/family things while being a serious meditator. And that would be a much better world. This is an open area of research and an extremely important area of research.  Safety and effectiveness (including consistency, monotonicity, ease of starting, initial palatability and interpretability, ideoloogical non-clashing, minimizing negative musculoskeletal involvement, minimizing “temporary trauma,” ease of talking about with other people, everything.</p>

<p>One way to resolve possible contradictions somehow involving badness being good is to make the distinction between something feeling bad and something being bad. That is, one might accept that feeling bad can sometimes be good. Further, to equivocate, one might accept that feeling bad can sometimes straightforwardly feel good!  (Some people will say, of course! cf. “hurts so good,” painful pleasure, massages, erotic pain, etc.)</p>
<p>The deeper thing, here, is something like “goodness” and “badness” are words and a person’s concepts of goodness and badness will contextually, contingently, and idosyncratically apply to, and in the context of, complex phenomenology and knowing that will be a complex mixture of valenced and unvalenced experience. And those concepts and that phenomenology and the relationship between the two will change as life and meditation progresses.</p>

<h3>Extremity replay and creativity: panic, trauma, sexual arousal</h3>
<p>Sometimes old stuff will “come up” (come into awareness). Sometimes it will be obvious that it’s coming up to “burn off” (become stably absent) and other times this won’t be obvious (or it needs to come up but it’s not yet time for it to “burn off.”</p>
<p>The general principle is that sometimes the mind needs to at least partially re-experience something bad in order to make sense of it or fully metabolize it so better things can happen in the future.</p>
<p>(Also, sometimes the mind, in the course of problem-solving puts together things in novel (and not entirely correct) ways that are temporarily scary [terrifying] or otherwise bad [horrible].)</p>
<p>Sometimes this old  or new stuff will be quite experientially extreme:</p>
<p>e.g. panic attacks, derealization, depersonalization, automaticity, edging into fugue states, air hunger, traumatic sleep paralysis, distorted phenomenology, fragmented phenomenemogy, weird feeling ness, strange feeling ness, re-living or de-novo inventing medical scares, feel like dying, feel having a stroke, confusion (from low blood sugar or a bad trip or transient psychosis for whatever reason), “brain not working, “mind not working,” “feel like you’re going [permanently] crazy,” “can’t think straight,” “feels like I’m dying/I am dying,” seeming or sense or awareness of critical wrongness, “sleep or dream wrongness like vision or consciousness are distorted during dreaming, altered states of consciousness from fevers or infections or metabolic or digestive or etc illness or fatigue or brain fog, or weird transient consciousness-altering bloodflow hiccups for whatever reason, childhood night terrors or sleep disturbances or panic attacks, suicidal ideation, suicidal impulse/urge, fuzziness, fogginess, unreality, static, chaos, dissolution, dreaminess, drowsiness, liminality, (partial) loss of mental control or unified will, medical scares or realities for yourself or friends or family, feel like you’re (re-/newly-)experiencing a traumatic event or someone else’s if you witnessed it or helped by e.g. calling 911 or emergency services in your country, or overheard, or inferred, etc. —so go to the e.r., have a friend talk you down, see a doctor about risk factors. If you’re experiencing an extreme event, usually it’s just a mind thing and sometimes it’s a stroke, heart attack, etc. [Feeling out of control can sometimes come with very aversive feelings but being feeling of control isn’t inherently bad and doesn’t necessarily lead to bad outcomes. It can lead to good outcomes especially if that out-of-control-ness is burning off.]</p>
<p>When it’s safe, and usually it will be, you can learn (and likely need to learn, slowly, slowly, slowly, precisely) to enter into these states and transform them from the inside.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor but if you’re experiencing sudden and intense pain  then go to the emergency room. If not then just depends.</p>
<p>Sometimes the right thing to do is to not just let it be but to even facilitate whatever it is:</p>
<p>The right/good thing to do might be to go into fuzziness, into fog, into unclarity, temporarily and possibly for long minutes or hours, again and again. This can be extremely counterintuitive when you’re, say, seeking crystalline clarity or whatever turns out to be good (for you, in your concepts, mediately or ultimately).</p>
<p>Sometimes what comes up will at least partially feel good but might often feel in some ways unwanted or problematic:</p>
<p>An example of this is sexual fantasy and sexual arousal. A heuristic is that, if safe or sufficiently not costly, it’s usually good to indulge the fantasy, imagine the scenario, read the erotic story, write the erotic story, search for the pornography, etc.</p>
<p>If there is an impulse/urge to act out something sexual, to actualize something, then it just depends whether it’s good to do that. The heuristic, here, too, is that if it’s safe and sufficiently not costly to do so then seek the experience. If there are unsafe or costly elements then it can be better to work with the fantasy/desire/planning experience as such rather than working to consummate it. There will be many good and redemptive things in there to untangle, to get them separately from a sexual encounter, or you might come to find that wanting (and/or getting) the/an inherently sexual thing is, partially or wholly, temporarily or stably, good to get and that you should work on creating a context in which it’s safe and wholly good to get the thing or part of the thing mostly or partially just as it is.</p>
<h3>On falling asleep</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s good to use postures such as sitting without back support or standing, in order to avoid falling asleep (see the posture section for more postures and thoughts on postures). But, it can be extremely profitable to meditate while curled up comfortably in bed both while falling asleep for the night, right upon waking up (without even opening one’s eyes), and also during the day. One can drift in and out of meditation, sleep, and reverie (sleep and reverie could be conceived as falling under the surrender portion of p2 but don’t have to be.).</p>
<p>One could imagine that meditating in liminal states could lead to “bad form” or meditating incorrectly. But, I have found this to not be the case, at least empirically. It seems to be the case that this protocol is specified both precisely enough and generally enough that meditating and drifting (reverie) and sleeping seems to be extremely valuable, especially when often, sometimes, or eventually mixed with meditation in other postures.</p>
<h3>A gentle onramp</h3>
<p><strong>Mark 8:55 AM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>5-30 minutes of a prelim exercise, followed by 2-15 minutes of the meta protocol (retrospectively on those 5-30 minutes), 1-2 times per day, would be a gentle, powerful onramp.</p>
<p>I would use the meta protocol to semi-retrospectively determine which prelim exercises, how to personally enact them, for what duration, for how often, would be good.</p>
<p>It would be fine to go down them in order, or to make index cards, or to paste them into a spreadsheet and keep track of frequency or duration in some way.</p>
<p>Main practice p2 is sort of the heart of the main protocol, so eventually one would want to start puzzling it out and easing into that, too, interleaving with prelim/aux practices and the meta protocol. Eventually one will start acquiring better and better intuitions about what to do when, as well as facility with navigating the document and dipping into it for ideas and refreshing on the text, to aid practice.</p>
<p>More questions welcome and please poke for different kinds/styles of answers if there’s something better</p>

<p><strong>Mark 9:03 AM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not universally true, but, generally, “forcing,” “powering through,” or “needle-threading in order to keep going and going” should be avoided because these can create puzzles that need to be laboriously undone later to make further progress.</p>
<p>If something seems like it’s “jamming” or “grinding,” I would halt that prelim/aux exercise and engage the meta protocol to see if that illuminates a better thing to do. The meta protocol itself can jam, in which case one can do lighter and lighter versions of the meta protocol (as described in the meta protocol section), or do the “meta meta protocol” (apply the meta protocol to itself), or browse through the document and choose something else to do, as per intuition (such as other prelim/aux practices or one of the main practices), or take a break and do something different and/or fun.

<p><strong>Mark 9:12 AM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For intuitions, to my mind, meditation is less like strength training and more like a single [many-typed, many-peg] Tower of Hanoi-type puzzle, if that makes sense. Long-range, global [maximum] wayfinding through a multidimensional, nonmonotonic space. (edited)</p>
<p>And the [open set of] prelim/aux practices reveal new dimensions of movement and new feedback loops, to be fed into the global wayfinding engine [automatically and by application of the meta protocol]. (edited)
And then p2 is the enactment of global wayfinding which includes upgrading itself en route, interleaving handoffs to other practices for indirect upgrades, and finally undoing and self-transcending itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mark 9:33 AM</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not universally, but generally, increases in muscle tension (including subtle, slow-growing) and contortions of face and posture mean it’s important to cut over to or at least interleave the meta protocol. An “uncoiled” posture such as sitting without back support, or standing, can make it easier to detect increases in muscle tension (though reclining and supported postures should be used, too, for decreasing incidental factors).</p>
<p>Shaking, twitching, emoting, vocalizations, and large movements are sometimes necessary and sometimes “self-distraction” (and sometimes a mixture). The meta protocol can be engaged to sort though and piece apart what should be allowed and encouraged and what should gently be disengaged or blocked.</p>

<h3>Nutrition</h3>
<p>I am not a doctor or other kind of licensed health professional, and this is not medical or nutritional advice.</p>
<p>If you are lacking mental or physical stamina for meditation, you might try adding butter and/or MCT oil to your diet. (Some MCT oils have three different lengths and some just have two lengths. Sometimes just two lengths is advertised as “better” in some way, but I felt like I was getting some kind of weird metabolic deficiency on the two lengths variety. That last longer length chain seemed to really be good to have in there, for some reason, at least prior to adaptation, which I didn’t try to do.) Less likely to be helpful, but depends, you might try adding a bit more cheese or other animal saturated fat to your diet. (Each will have different chain length profiles.) You might also try adding a bit of choline, which can take a few weeks to month for you to notice any difference.</p>
<p>If you’re not, consider jogging or other aerobic exercise to you life, 2–5 times per week for 40 minutes, minimum, to avoid fat metabolism disfunction. You maybe should probably get your cholesterol checked periodically, too.</p>
<p>You might also consider adding non-rancid flax seed, some good source of sulfer,  and/or some quality source of collagen.</p>
<p>You might also switch to all slow-release carbs, to even out insulin. The steadier energy release is, the less you’ll have boom and bust mental energy before and after meals. You want super-steady energy release for hours and hours. If you have insulin resistance, your body will release fuel from storage too slowly, and you’ll have to rely more on proximity to meals for meditation enablement.</p>
<p>If you have insulin smoothed out, your food craving system will be smarter, and you should generally indulge food cravings for weird food, as best you can.</p>
<p>If you’re eating fewer, larger meals, be careful with your kidneys and liver.</p>
<p>Consider a multivitamin in powder form or in many pills per day, so you can titrate. I know multivitamins are supposed to do nothing or be detrimental, but you might find subdoses to be seemingly very helpful.</p>
