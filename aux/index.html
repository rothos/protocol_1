        <h4 class='grey'>About these practices (from the protocol document)</h4>
        <p class='grey'>
        These practices won’t take you all the way and can even tie you in knots, but they can get things going and sometimes unstick things. They are presented in no particular order.
        </p><p class='grey'>
        Consider creating for yourself and/or submitting your own preliminary/auxiliary practices for inclusion in this document. Submission could be very useful to other people. If you wished that it had been here, instead of you needing to discover it, or you just think it’d be useful to other people, please submit. Preliminary practices are intended to be unsystematized, ad hoc, a little bit vague, brief, and jargon-free. Ideally they are titled with a short, imperative phrase, but that isn’t necessary. Your submissions will be indicated by your initials or pseudonymous initials (please choose/indicate).
        </p><p class='grey'>
        Don’t take these too seriously. Don’t reify them. They might or might not point to deep, metaphysical truths. If they happen to, it’s probably not in the way you initially think. You might or might not have to intermittently throw some or all of these away, forget them, in order to make progress.
        </p><p class='grey'>
        Something being in a preliminary/auxiliary practice isn’t committing to any particular ontology. Take these as experiential games, dialogues between words and experience, physical or mental action and result.

Ask a part of you, or something in you, how can I help? What do you need? (You might also ask yourself, what does this need?) What would be good for you? What’s good on your terms (in all of that), and how can I help you get that?\n\nBefore moving on to something else, you might ask, what would make it ok for me/us/you/this to pause/end/stop exploring this (for now)?", "assume even worse/worst:\n\nAssume an even worse version of the (seemingly?) bad thing that’s (seemingly?) true. Fill in all the cracks of the worse-/worst-ness. What would you do, how would you respond if this worse/worst case were true?", "be a baby, be prenatal:\n\nLet yourself be a baby. Let yourself be prenatal. The reality of that, imagined or immersive flashback. Suspend disbelief. What was that experience concretely like, good and bad?", "the opposite:\n\nAsk if there’s a part of you that believes the opposite (of this/X). Is there a part of you that believes that opposite belief, ongoingly, parallel, to the first part of you?", "counterfactual replacement:\n\nAsk, might X be ok, instead of Y? What good things would happen if X? What bad things would happen if X?", "truths, etc.:\n\nTry resting in how things seem vs how things feel vs how things appear vs what might be true or false vs what you know vs what you believe vs what you understand vs what you think vs what god would say is true vs what’s real vs what feels right vs what things look like vs what’s going on, here vs how you’d describe things vs…", "forward vs backward:\n\nAsk, is this/X forward(s) or backward(s)?", "desire, etc.:\n\nAsk, what do you long for, hope for, desire, want, care about, value, lust for/after, love—to do, be have, associate with, pursue, acquire, achieve…", "philosophical meta:\n\nLet your be pulled into thinking about metaphysics, philosophy, epistemology, phenomenology, agathology, cosmology, eschatology, mereology, linguistics…\n\ncomment:\n\nSometimes, often, extreme, abstract meta can be a real, nondeferrable bottleneck. You might see if you can go concrete first, if you can defer that extreme, abstract meta. You might bring in the meta protocol. But, often you relatively can’t!", "alternatives explanations:\n\nAsk, what are alternative explanations, stories for this/X apparent thing?", "concrete memories:\n\nGently incline towards experiencing fully concrete, episodic, experiential memories.", "options, pros and cons:\n\nList some options. Consider the pros and cons of choosing each option and not choosing each option. (So every option will have its own collection of pros and cons. And then you might juxtapose the pros and cons of pairs of options, and so on.)", "trigger yourself:\n\nExpose yourself (carefully) to things that provoke extreme reactions. If you are accidentally or incidentally triggered, take advantage of it.", "intuition:\n\nTemporarily let yourself [come to] know (or understand) without dictating the why of how you know or the how of how you know. (cf. radically unstructured coming to know/understand.)", "counterfactual past additions:\n\nWhat would it have been good to experience, at any point when you were younger, in the recent or distant past? How might that have gone? What was the experience, maybe sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, feel, meaning…", "memory/imagination triggering:\n\nThrough memory, imagination, or imaginative riffs, trigger yourself, distress yourself.", "urges and impulses:\n\nFeel ongoing and the bleeding-edge arising edges of impulses, urges, impellment, compellment, compulsion", "three-dimensional, unforced scanning:\n\nSlowly explore the surface and physical interiority of the body with attention. Don’t force attention to where attention doesn’t easily go or where it slides away. Let it go; it will surely open up later, and you will surely come back to it later, possibly effortlessly and costlessly folded into something else."];
